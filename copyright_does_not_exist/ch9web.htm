      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman">The story of hackers</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">, 
        phreakers, telephone companies, and justice is told (from an American 
        perspective) in Bruce Sterling's </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>The 
        Hacker Crackdown</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> (1992). The 
        reason this science-fiction author decided to write a history of hackers, 
        is exactly what I have tried to illustrate with my arguments so far: that 
        aspects of electronic cultures overlap. The whole thing started when the 
        U.S. Secret Service tried to clip the wings off the underground hacker 
        movement, and on some occasions strayed far outside the limits for law 
        enforcement intervention.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">They really wanted to </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>nail</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> the hackers, who had grown extremely powerful 
        in just a few years, through a national crackdown (hence the title of 
        the book), with the intent of teaching the hackers a lesson. This crackdown 
        was named </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Operation Sundevil. 
        </i>The Secret Service busted into the homes of American teenagers, grabbing 
        everything with wires coming out of it. The computer, the printer, the 
        portable stereo, mom's and dad's computers, all of it. That wasn't enough: 
        they also took </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>manuals</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, or anything remotely resembling one: science-fiction 
        novels and regular compact disc records, for example.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of you can probably figure out what 
        happens if you take all the hacker's machines away from him or her. He/she 
        becomes totally powerless, with no means of keeping in contact with friends 
        or communicate in open electronic discussions. The hackers not only had 
        their wings clipped; they also had their mouths sewn shut. This is exactly 
        what the Secret Service wanted, and probably no one would have been concerned 
        - not even Bruce Sterling - if they had stayed content to just raid hackers. 
        Many hackers arrested during the crackdown were given sentences that prohibited 
        them from using computers for a certain period of time.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">On March 1, 1990, the Secret Service committed 
        a mistake: they went into the gaming company </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Steve 
        Jackson Games</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, in Austin, TX, 
        and confiscated all the computers that they could find, including one 
        which had a completely new game stored on its hard drive: </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>GURPS 
        Cyberpunk</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> (GURPS sands for Generic 
        Universal Role Playing System, developed by Steve Jackson Games to make 
        it easier to switch between roleplaying settings without having to switch 
        gaming systems).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Steve Jackson Games, therefore, make </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><i>role-playing games</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, 
        and the game GURPS Cyberpunk was written by a hacker going by the pseudonym 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Mentor</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        (his real name was </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Lloyd Blankenship</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">), and who worked as an author at the company. 
        When the company demanded the return of its computer, or at least the 
        files for GURPS Cyberpunk (which was just about to be marketed), their 
        request was denied, with the justification that it was not a game but 
        rather a manual for perpetrating computer crime. Mentor himself was a 
        hacker, and had written an excellent and realistic game which focused 
        on breaking into different computer systems. The game was considered dangerous.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anyone who's seen a roleplaying game knows 
        that it is a matter of a kind of </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>books</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> used as reference material for the games, 
        in which the players try to create and enter a world of the imagination. 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>GURPS Cyberpunk</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, 
        therefore, was a </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>BOOK</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, released by a publisher, with an ISBN number 
        just like any other book. The fact that the U.S. Secret Service had tried 
        to stop the publication of </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>a book</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, simply because the contents were held to 
        be </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>too dangerous</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, 
        was not well received by conscientious citizens of the U.S. The freedom 
        of the press is constitutional in the U.S. (like in Sweden), and a fantasy-oriented 
        role-playing game like </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>GURPS Cyberpunk</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> has the same official right to exist as 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>The New York Times</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, whether it teaches computer crime techniques 
        or not - as long as it doesn't advocate the perpetration of crimes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">After a period of fuss in regards to the 
        Steve Jackson Games case, the </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Electronic 
        Frontier Foundation</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> was formed, 
        led by (among others) the Grateful Dead lyricist </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>John 
        Perry Barlow</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">.<sup><a href="#FTNT1">(1)</a></sup></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> They were financially supported by </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Mitch Kapor</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, 
        who was one of the creators of the spreadsheet program </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Lotus 
        1-2-3</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">. The organization had supporters 
        among the users of the electronic conferencing system </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>The 
        Well</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, created by the magazine 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Whole Earth Review</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> in San Francisco. WELL is short for </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, and in principle functions as a gigantic 
        BBS with connections to the Internet. (You could also view it as a metaphorical 
        &quot;well of knowledge&quot;.) Many users of The Well are old hippies 
        and Grateful Dead fans, who dearly value their rights of free speech and 
        assembly. Many are what I call university hackers, engineers, or programmers. 
        The hippie-programmer combination is not unusual at The Well. (I mentioned 
        earlier that the hippie culture originated at the universities in the 
        Bay area. Consider Mitch Kapor, for example - before he started making 
        business software, he was a meditation instructor.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">San Francisco is almost a chapter of its 
        own. It is the Meccha of the electronic world. The universities Berkeley 
        and Stanford are in the area, and close by is Silicon Valley. The majority 
        of modern computer technology comes from San Francisco. It is where the 
        first personal computer, the Altair, was built, and it is also the home 
        of EFF, The Well, Whole Earth Review, Wired, and MONDO 2000. Virtually 
        all forms of popular electronic culture have originated in San Francisco, 
        and it is also where Virtual Reality was first marketed. At the same time, 
        I would say that San Francisco's reputation is a little exaggerated. It 
        has just as much to do with American attitudes and marketing as real knowledge, 
        and the expertise that computer technology rests on has been researched 
        and developed all across the world. However, it is a natural nexus for 
        amateurs as well as the pros of the computer industry. Silicon Valley, 
        in particular, has had great significance, with its thousands of bored 
        upper-middle-class engineers waiting with anticipation for anything to 
        happen on the electronic frontier. These people constitute the innermost 
        core of EFF.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">EFF has quality contacts inside the entire 
        American software and hardware industries, and champion </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>the 
        electronic rights of human beings</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">. 
        The organization does not protect hackers, as is often said, but it protects 
        the rights of hackers. EFF is therefore a </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>civil 
        rights organization</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">. Like the 
        cyberpunks, EFF is ideologically influenced by libertarianism, but on 
        many issues (such as &quot;intellectual property&quot;), they are on a 
        collision course with the libertarians. I will now try to illustrate how 
        threats against civil rights and individual integrity are manifested in 
        the information society.<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Right to Communicate</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman">EFF stated (and states) that it is 
        a violation of integrity to take someone's computer away from them. It 
        is as violating as taking away the right for an individual to use pen 
        and paper. A hacker is used to communicating with the world by computer, 
        through BBSs, the Internet, etc. Taking the computer from the hacker is 
        akin to taking the typewriter (word processor, pens, or paper) from the 
        author. EFF sued the Secret Service for constitutional violations in connection 
        with the raid on Steve Jackson Games - and they won. The organization 
        now works towards a constitutional amendment protecting electronic expression.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In short: a computer criminal should not 
        be prevented from using computers (everyone uses them nowadays), but from 
        committing more computer crime. You don't prevent a counterfeiter from 
        working at the mint - you teach him to stop printing fake currency. Properly 
        used, the illegal hacker's knowledge is useful to society.<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Integrity</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman">EFF has grown since its inception, 
        and currently sponsors a public debate about computers and humans in a 
        future information society. It wants to protect the right of the individual 
        not to be registered and controlled by authorities, simply because it 
        is now possible thanks to the advent of the computer. The organization 
        therefore advocates the use of the encryption program PGP, which I discussed 
        earlier. Why? Well, S&#196;PO (the Swedish National Security Police) - 
        or some other internal intelligence organization - should not be allowed 
        to examine all postal transmissions in Sweden. They should not be able 
        to read all electronic mail, either. </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>But</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, they could (if they so wished) put a fast, 
        efficient computer to the task of searching all electronic mail for certain 
        keywords, in order to quickly trace new political groups. (It is astonishingly 
        simple to construct such a program; I could even do it myself.) Let's 
        say that every piece of electronic mail containing the words &quot;REVOLUTION&quot;, 
        &quot;WEAPONS&quot;, or &quot;SOCIETY&quot;, in any combination, would 
        be copied and sent to an analyst. You would never know.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">According to </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Philip 
        Zimmerman</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> (creator of PGP), it 
        is precisely because of this that one should encrypt one's mail so that 
        no third party could read it.&nbsp;Of course, in democratic Sweden, we 
        would prevent internal organizations from doing such horrible things. 
        Nevertheless, there might be good reasons to encrypt one's mail. Why?</font></p>
      <p>F<font face="Times New Roman">irst: there are people besides S&#196;PO 
        and the local revenue office that might want to see if you're writing 
        something inappropriate. Second: do you trust the authorities? If so, 
        why not just send them a copy of your personal communications, so that 
        they can check them and be sure that you're not sitting around conspiring? 
        What do you, a conscientious citizen, have to hide? Why not let the police 
        search your house for illegal weapons? You see where I'm going - encryption 
        protects the privacy of the individual from governmental intrusion.<sup><a href="#FTNT2">(2)</a></sup></font> 
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">All the chaos surrounding PGP started on 
        April 10, 1991, when the U.S. Congress made a statement about encryption 
        programs. It clearly stated that it expected everyone involved in the 
        manufacture of encryption technology, of any kind, to incorporate back 
        doors so that the government could read the encrypted information if necessary. 
        The message was a frightening one: you may keep secrets - but keep no 
        secrets from the government. Shortly after, Zimmerman's colleague, Kelly 
        Goen, went around San Francisco and distributed PGP do different BBSs 
        using pay phones. (!) He held that Congress was in violation of the Constitution, 
        and performed this act in order to protect American society from totalitarian 
        supervision. recently, the European Union sent a similar missive to the 
        nations of Europe. (Americans are much more sensitive to these matters 
        than Swedes - which is fortunate, I should say. <i>Translator's note: 
        </i>Nevertheless, and ironically perhaps, the privacy rights of individuals 
        in the U.S. are in much worse shape than in the Scandinavian countries 
        - due to <i>private</i> record-keeping organizations such as the credit 
        bureaus, which have become a sort of universal information source that 
        sells all the information it has to anyone willing to pay for it).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Encryption, by the way, is not expressly 
        an American thing. Us Swedes have been in the cipher game for at least 
        as long. As early as WWII, we decrypted German communications going through 
        Sweden. In 1984, the &quot;expert&quot; </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Ragnar 
        Eriksson</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> and his friends at S&#196;PO 
        made an encryption system which, with the approval of the executive branch, 
        they tried to sell together with other security &quot;know-how&quot;. 
        Alas, the system was worthless, since S&#196;PO has never had any encryption 
        experts worth their name, and no one wanted to buy the system.<sup><a href="#FTNT3">(3)</a></sup></font> 
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those who are professionally involved in 
        encryption (thus </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>not</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> S&#196;PO, but the military and the universities) 
        almost always encounter upstarts who think they've invented the world's 
        best encryption system. Common to all these parvenus is that they want 
        to keep their systems secret, as they consider themselves so bright that 
        no other person has ever been on the same track. All the pros release 
        their algorithms (encoding principles) and tell people how the system 
        works; if it is good enough, nobody can break the cipher </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>even</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> though they know how it works. Some examples 
        include DES (Data Encryption Standard), and IDEA (International Data Encryption 
        Algorithm) - which is used in PGP. (S&#196;PO did not want to publish 
        their algorithms...) Neither DES nor IDEA are impossible to crack - it's 
        just that it would take a few million years for today's computers to do 
        so, using current deciphering techniques.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As an illustrative example, I will mention 
        a common beginner's crypto which entails adding a sequence of random numbers 
        to a digitally stored text. It would be very hard to crack if the message 
        was not any longer than the sequence of numbers, but with longer messages 
        this randomness can be removed as easily as static can be filtered out 
        of a radio signal.<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Sweden Awakens</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman">Today, Swedish police have already 
        been guilty of questionable activities relating to the freedom of expression. 
        They have confiscated BBSs, used as an exchange medium for private electronic 
        mail, and probably also examined the private mail stored on these. This 
        has been carried out on suspicions that the BBSs were used in the distribution 
        of pirated software. It can be compared to sifting through all the mail 
        in one of the Postal Service's boxes simply on the suspicion that somewhere 
        in this box there is information about a crime. Would you want your mail 
        read simply because it happened to end up in the same box as a letter 
        from, say, a car theft ring? (I don't even know if the police have the 
        right to do such a thing, but I don't like the thought of it.)</font></p>
      <p> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;Holy Christ&quot;,</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> the police say, </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;those 
        who use a BBS are despicable hackers! Thatdoesn't have anything to do 
        with normal people's privacy, does it?&quot;</i></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's great that they were hackers, and not 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Jews</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        or </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>immigrants</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, 
        but simply regular, honest hackers, which we all know are terribly criminal. 
        Hundreds of BBS users, regular Swedes with no criminal records, have had 
        their right to privacy abridged simply because they fall under the fuzzy 
        (to say the least) category of </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>hackers</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">? And the police are upset because they have 
        found encrypted material in these BBSs, which is hard or impossible to 
        read. I </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>really </i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">feel 
        sorry for them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Consider that today's BBSs will, in the 
        future, be replaced by the Internet, through which you are expected to 
        send all your mail. What will happen then? Are we going to have cops running 
        around auditing the mail, seizing large quantities of mail when they suspect 
        something illegal might be lurking inside the pile?&nbsp;But, but... the 
        police follow the law, and according to the law, electronic documents 
        or communications are not covered by the freedom of the press. Hopefully, 
        they are protected under the freedom of speech, but not even this is certain. 
        Everything is very fuzzy, and no one seems to know what the facts are. 
        Legislation is in progress.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Considering all the threats against integrity, 
        the observant citizen naturally wants protection against surveillance, 
        and therefore acquires an encryption program. American intelligence agencies 
        want you to use their &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; instead of your own crypto. 
        The &quot;Clipper Chip&quot; is a very good encryption program which, 
        according to themselves, only the Secret Service has a back door to. The 
        European governments have something similar in the works, which has at 
        the time of this writing not been formalized.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another use for encryption (besides making 
        your mail unreadable) is to put a </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>seal</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> on your messages - a kind of electronic 
        check digit, which can mathematically prove that the sender is who he/she 
        claims to be, </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>and</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        that the content has not been changed. This way, electronic bulletins 
        can be mass-distributed without having to worry about somebody &quot;cutting&quot; 
        them, at least not without being noticed. This method is used by, among 
        others, SWIFT, which is an international bank transaction system.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Those interested in the underlying technology 
        of encryption should pick up a book on the subject. American cryptographers 
        (like Zimmerman) are monitored by military intelligence agencies. (I don't 
        know if this is the case for Swedish crypto-scientists.) In some countries, 
        e. g. France, all encryption by private individuals is prohibited.<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Swedish Rights</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman">What about civil rights in Sweden 
        and the rest of Europe? Is an organization like EFF necessary on this 
        side of the Atlantic as well&gt; Maybe - especially since European police 
        agencies learn about computer crime fighting by peeking at the USA. In 
        Sweden, police have also confiscated computers and disks, but also magazines, 
        T-shirts, and printers, in American fashion. The police in the U.S. didn't 
        know what to do with all the stuff they seized - and the Swedish police 
        doesn't know either. It's not a mystery why it takes a virtual </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><i>eternity</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        to sort out hacker crimes, considering the amount of junk that the investigators 
        collect as evidence. When I did an inventory of my own collection of about 
        200 disks, it took me over a month, and I only made superficial notes 
        of the contents of each file. A criminal investigator has to be </font>

        more thorough for his evidence to stand up in court, and a well-organized 
        hacker can, in worse cases, have </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>thousands 
        </i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">of disks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The time span and delays for the prosecution 
        of a hacker is worse than those for refugees, with the difference that 
        these cases are eventually dismissed. To the extent that the hackers ever 
        see their equipment again, it is most often outdated and without value. 
        The police are still holding computers seized six years ago.&nbsp;In many 
        cases, the hackers' computers are considered instruments of crime rather 
        than communication channels. Even Swedish hackers' rights of free expression 
        have been infringed during police raids - whether they have been criminals 
        or not. Remember where </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Cervantes</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> spent his time while writing </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Don 
        Quixote</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">. (In prison.) Should 
        the pen and paper have been wrested from him simply because he was a criminal? 
        In at least one case, the Swedish police has been charged with violating 
        rights of free speech and freedom of information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As early as 1984, Sweden's National Police 
        Board determined that seizure of equipment could cause problems, and that 
        this should only be done in exceptional cases. Today, it's more of the 
        rule than the exception. If they had been able to follow their own directives, 
        which said to copy the information and lend it to the victim, the situation 
        would have been much more pleasant for both parties. In that case, the 
        hackers would not have had to have their computers stored in police warehouses 
        for decades.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We also have a law of criminal forfeiture, 
        which means that equipment used in the commission of a crime can be considered 
        forfeited, and subject to sale or destruction. This might be reasonable 
        in the case of specialized equipment like lock picks, &quot;blue boxes&quot;, 
        or other directly criminal equipment, but </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>computers</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">? If a typewriter is used for criminal purposes, 
        it is thus forfeited? Can we have just an ounce of freedom of speech, 
        too?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The information age has now caused some 
        prosecutions against the distribution of specific, protected information 
        to become completely unmanageable. Are you struck by the same thought 
        as I? That this plays into the hands of the cyberpunks? If information 
        really </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>can</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        be owned - can we in that case uphold its copyright in a rational manner? 
        Or is our old society in about to change with regards to copyright?&nbsp;Relax, 
        there is a cure for all this. </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Computers</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> are very good at controlling large amounts 
        of information, and quickly at that. The organization </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>BSA</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> (</font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Business 
        Software Alliance</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, an association 
        of companies in the software industry) is apparently prepared to have 
        a program called </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Search II</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> stand witness in cases against companies 
        suspected of piracy. The program works by reading the contents of a computer's 
        hard drive and registering which programs are installed. The reason for 
        doing this as opposed to seizing equipment, is that corporations, as opposed 
        to hackers, raise one </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>hell</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> of a racket if you take all their computers. 
        So far, so good.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When companies and (sometimes) people are 
        charged with piracy, the police rely on BSA and the Search II program 
        for technical expertise. It is a bit strange that BSA, which represents 
        the plaintiff, is also relied on to collect evidence. Strange, to say 
        the least. Now, allow me to insert a small provocation, which might help 
        you think along new lines:<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> Do we want computers to witness against 
        corporations and individuals?<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> Why not leave the entire justice system 
        to computers? Automated, powerful, cost-effective - comes in all colors 
        - no difficult interrogations or delayed trials...<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman">Personally, I don't think we should 
        let computers stand witness until they're at least as intelligent as humans. 
        But if a human can testify under oath as to the credibility of what the 
        computer says, then OK. We have for many years allowed objects to act 
        as witnessed, or </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>evidence</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, as we call it. All evidence, however, has 
        to be interpreted by one or more people before it becomes practically 
        meaningful. What is relevant is that computers are evidence which has 
        a hitherto unlimited potential for lying, since they can be manipulated 
        in any way by anyone. I think we should stay clear of electronic justice 
        for a long time - the risk of judicial corruption is obvious.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The question of computers keeping tabs on 
        individuals is a little more sinister than it appears at first glance 
        - information technology, if properly applied, can be used to prevent 
        or </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>totally eliminate</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> certain types of crime. Do we really want 
        this? Do we want an intelligent breathalyzer in our car, which tells us 
        when we can't drive? Perhaps such supervision of driving habits will be 
        legislated in the future. Do we want the recipient of a phone call to 
        always be able to know who we are?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, there is a program called </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Net Nanny</i>, which is a &quot;baby-sitter&quot; 
        for the Internet. It can be set to supervise children communicating over 
        the Internet, and will automatically shut down the connection if some 
        &quot;dirty old man&quot; starts asking for a name or a phone number. 
        Even if the purpose seems noble, one could ask what would happen if an 
        extraordinarily benevolent government should apply such filters to all 
        of its citizens' communications. I mean, why not pull the plug as soon 
        as someone starts talking about certain kinds of explosives, or starts 
        using to many violent words - just in case... (Note: irony.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As opposed to a cop, the computer is </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><i>everywhere</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, 
        and basically free. Should we let our possibility to choose between obeying 
        or ignoring the law be eliminated by computers? Should they become our 
        collective, electronic conscience, and give us an electronically monitored 
        utopia in which there is no crime, since no crimes </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>can</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> be committed? It is not as simple a question 
        as you could think, if you consider it for a while... the EFF, and other 
        organizations, are of the opinion that it is </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>inhuman</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> to take away the individual's right to disobey. 
        So far, all social control has been based on self-control, a condition 
        which is threatened by automation. There is a risk of principles being 
        upheld for the sole reason that the computers have been programmed to 
        uphold them. This is one of the things that </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Paul

      <p><font face="Times New Roman">For your information, I can reveal that 
        it is </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>in no way</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        illegal to write books on bomb construction - provided that you do not 
        encourage the reader to apply this knowledge. (If you're in the military, 
        and happen to write such a manual for internal use, you might even get 
        promoted.) It may be morally questionable, especially considering that 
        the readers are often teenagers, but it is definitely not prohibited.

        <font face="Times New Roman"> makes a lot of funny statements which don't

      <p> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Datainspektionen</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        does a lot of really good things. Above all, they protect freedom of information 
        and individual privacy, and the right to know in which databases one is

        role of pontificator, which is not its purpose.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">From where will a Swedish EFF originate? 
        I would bet on its birth somewhere among people that guard the freedoms 
        of speech and the press. </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>F&#246;reningen 
        Gr&#228;vande Journalister</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> (&quot;The 
        Investigative Journalists' Association&quot;), with </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Anders 
        R Olsson</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> at the lead, has long 
        had an agenda reminiscent of the ideas of EFF. As far as I can understand, 
        this started with a book, written in 1985 by Anders Olsson, called </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Spelrum</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        (&quot;<i>Playing Field</i>&quot;). In it, he describes the complicated 
        structure of government, and its desire to control the individual, in 
        a captivating and agitative manner. What William S. Burroughs says through 
        his fictional accounts, Anders Olsson articulates through non-fiction, 
        to put it simply. He doesn't construct his theories based on libertarian 
        ideas about individual freedom, but rather on a description of the </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><i>machine</i>, which he calls </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Sweden, 
        Inc.</i>, as a gigantic, dominating social mechanism built on bureaucracy 
        and the wish to control the individual.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Anders has also advocated that journalists 
        should enlist the help of hackers to enter, and examine, the proprietary 
        computer systems of the government and other organizations. As described 
        in the previous chapter, this took place in the case of the </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Ausgebombt</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> BBS in V&#228;nersborg. In his book </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Yttrandefrihet och Tryckfrihet </i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">(&quot;Freedom of Speech and the Press&quot;), 
        he considers it fully justified to hack into computers owned by corporations, 
        governmental institutions, and other organizations, in order to obtain 
        information of public interest. He emphasizes that it is the </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>purpose</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> of the act, not the act in itself, that 
        is most important. In his opinion, the constitutional (Swedish) protection 
        of freedom of information, found in the articles on freedom of speech 
        and the press, protects the hacker while looking for information with 
        the intent of publicizing it.<sup><a href="#FTNT4">(4)</a></sup></font>

      freedom of information: <i>IT och det Fria Ordet - Myten om Storebror</i> 
      (&quot;Information Technology and the Free Word - the Myth of Big Brother&quot;), 
      where he shoes that the fear of oversight can be used to conceal more than 
      necessary; he defuses the paranoia surrounding large databases, and shows 
      that it is quite difficult to &quot;know everything about a person&quot; 
      through them. Instead, he points to another danger - giving confidential 
      privilege to information that should be public, by maintaining that it is 
      sensitive. He also defines four useful terms, which I interpret as follows:<br>
      <b>Freedom of Speech and of the Press</b> : The right to express one's opinion 
      in the ether or in the media, without risking being silenced or prosecuted.<br>
      <b>Privacy</b> : The right to be free from intrusion into individual privacy 
      by government or other institutions of power. (Computer databases, drug 
      testing, etc.)<br>
      <b>Freedom of Information</b> : The right to stay informed of the internal 
      structure of governments or other institutions of authority. (For example: 
      the Freedom of Information Act). This right is especially important to journalists.
