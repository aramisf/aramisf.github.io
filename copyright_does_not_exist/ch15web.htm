      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>I will now</b> try to summarize what 
        I've written so far, and synthesize this with a number of modern philosophical 
        ideas about people and our society. A cybernetic society is a society 
        of people who live in symbiosis with machines. To understand a society, 
        I employ a simplified concept of an individual, in which he or she is 
        viewed as a construct of information, communicating with the environment 
        by means of <i>symbols</i>.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        <img src="Image3.gif" width="334" height="137" border="1"> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In the figure, <b>memory</b> stands for 
        the stored patterns in the brain's neurons, <b>thought</b> is the reflections 
        and dreams (daydreams included) that we all have, and the <b>symbols</b> 
        are those chunks of information we exchange with the <b>environment</b>, 
        which can be single individuals as well as the entire family or society 
        that we live in. Such symbols can be human language, but also other conventions 
        that we don't think about much, such as pieces of paper with numbers on 
        them perceived as possessing value, or a certain type of clothing perceived 
        as indicating a certain status. For natural reasons, science uses well-defined 
        symbols called <i>paradigms</i>, which define:</font></p>
      <ol type=1>
        <li> 
          <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>What to observe<br>
            </b> </font> </p>
        <li> 
          <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>What questions to ask<br>
            </b> </font> </p>
        <li> 
          <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>How the questions should be asked<br>
            </b> </font> </p>
        <li> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>How the answers should be interpreted</b></font> 
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">(I'll take the opportunity to state that 
        I interpret the sociological-scientific concept of a symbol, as well as 
        the concept of a paradigm, in a very pragmatic and personal manner - raise 
        a hand, whoever cares. This is high-level hermeneutics. Pardon the ten-dollar 
        words).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is these concepts that the hackers, with 
        Zen and G&#246;del behind them, contest in their motto number 4: <i>Hackers 
        should be judged for their hacking, not according to suspicious criteria 
        such as academic performance, age, race, or social status</i>, and in 
        3: <i>Distrust authority.</i> It's an attempt to break out of a system 
        that is perceived as wrong. Marvin (the guy with the telephone cards) 
        spoke in a radio interview of his dissatisfaction with companies hiring 
        people with degrees instead of caring about their <i>real</i> skills and 
        in this way pointed out the shortcomings in our formal social system. 
        Burroughs thought that society would try to increasingly control the thoughts 
        of its citizens, whether its public servants wanted to or not. It is said 
        that an enlightened individual must have the ability to <i>exit</i> the 
        system to see the real patterns behind it, which can't be described using 
        words, paper, or clothing. At the same time, the symbols are vital to 
        our communication as well as our society as a whole. An intelligent individual 
        can, using symbols, detect intelligence in him- or herself as well as 
        in other individuals. We can now view society from a similar perspective:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        <img src="Image4.gif" width="334" height="137" border="1"> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> But what's this? It looks just the same! 
        That's right. In this case, <b>memory</b> is the collective memory in 
        the form of books, films, CDs, or computer programs, stored in libraries 
        or in our homes. <b>Thought</b> is the same as <i>culture</i>, the ongoing 
        process that continuously affects our living conditions. Note also that 
        the <b>symbols</b>, in this case our relationship towards other societies 
        or aggregations, is not the same as our culture. Sociologists often refer 
        to this model as the <i>collective consciousness</i>. As for myself, I've 
        nailed together the concept of <i>superindividual</i> for this model. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The symbols show only those parts of our 
        thoughts, culture, that we <i>want</i> to show. As is well known, this 
        is also how an individual works. An intelligent society detects intelligence 
        in other societies <i>and</i> individuals. The individuals that make up 
        society can very well endeavor to analyze the thoughts that society thinks, 
        but the task is virtually insurmountable, like if the individual neurons 
        in our brains were to try to understand the thoughts of the entire brain. 
        (These arguments originate in research of artificial intelligence in non-formal 
        systems and sociological science).&nbsp;This model is not limited to describing 
        societies and individuals as intelligent organisms, but can also be applied 
        to corporations, military organizations, and others. It is this <i>formal 
        system</i>, the complex society, which sociologists study as scientists, 
        William Burroughs criticizes as an author, and Zen debunks as a philosophy</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now that we've agreed on a common view of 
        individuals and societies, we can start defining cybernetics. I said earlier 
        that cybernetics means <i>people or society in symbiosis with machines</i>. 
        To illustrate, here's a practical example:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        <img src="Image5.gif" width="298" height="123" border="1"> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> We see two individuals, A and B, communicating 
        by way of symbols. So far there's no problem. If we, for <br>
        example, suppose that these individuals communicate by sending <b>letters</b> 
        to each other, a problem could occur if one of them has a slight vision 
        problem.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"> <img src="Image6.gif" width="301" height="102" border="1"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Since people are so ingenious, they naturally 
        find a way around this problem. They attempt to <i>improve</i> their natural 
        conditions. I will illustrate this with an invention that was created 
        around 1290 AD:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"> <img src="Image7.gif" width="304" height="110" border="1"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> We have here one of the very first cybernetic 
        innovations. Reality has been improved by a small opto-mechanical construction 
        that we take for granted in today's society. All people that wear glasses 
        are therefore <i>cyborgs</i>, people who live out their days on Earth 
        in harmony with machines. We're so used to this that we hardly ever think 
        about it. If you're a little more vain, you can get contact lenses, and 
        then you invite the machine into your own body. Glasses constitute one 
        of the modifications that are meant to improve our ability to communicate 
        with the rest of the world. Other cybernetic modifications are aimed at 
        making life more comfortable and bearable for the individual: the wheelchair, 
        the cane, etc. Some are vital, like the pacemaker. Of course, now I've 
        just listed inventions that &quot;correct&quot; human disabilities. Naturally, 
        you can &quot;improve&quot; regular people too, with the aid of binoculars, 
        electronic devices for night vision, etc. The telephone, for example, 
        improves us so as to allow us to communicate over enormous distances. 
        We can also establish <i>hyper-communication</i>.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;<img src="Image8.gif" width="307" height="151" border="1"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> One such medium is hypertext, which is 
        better than normal text. We can also improve our possibilities as a society 
        to exchange and distribute information with the help of transaction systems, 
        satellite TV, etc. Yet another improvement of our perception - and the 
        most revolutionary - will be Virtual Reality.&nbsp;There are, however, 
        a few uncanny aspects of this society. Like, for example, the previously 
        mentioned <i>NetNanny</i>, or when Aftonbladet on July 15, 1995, reassuringly 
        announced that TV sets can now be fitted with a chip that is programmable 
        by parents who don't want their children to watch excessively violent, 
        pornographic, or otherwise unsuitable programs. When the kids try to tune 
        in to a blocked program, the screen turns blue. Fantastic. The question 
        is just who is being programmed: the chip or the children? One of the 
        parents interviewed by Aftonbladet wants to prevent the kids from watching, 
        among other things, <i>SOS - P&#229; Liv och D&#246;d</i> (cf. the American 
        TV show <i>Rescue 911</i>), which is a program that shows films of real 
        accidents and rescue efforts. What's next? Isn't it just as well to turn 
        off those terrible news, so that you can raise your children in a protective 
        bubble, as far removed from the world as the Russians ever were under 
        Stalin? The risk of abuse of this, and similar, invention is terrible 
        and great.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">And this was only an example of what a relatively 
        stupid chip can accomplish. We are already forced to note that our society 
        is no longer formed solely by people, and that not even <i>people</i> 
        are formed solely by other people. When almost every store has electronic 
        anti-theft systems on every product, there's no longer a need for honesty 
        as a virtue, because it becomes <i>impossible</i> to act dishonestly - 
        and thus, moral limits are turned into real, physical limits with the 
        help of technology. We are so singularly obsessed with the public good 
        provided by these machines that we don't question what is happening. A 
        store alarm is nothing to complain about, since it only concerns itself 
        with thieves&#133; <i>One fine day</i>, we'll be hanging around with machines 
        that automatically inject sedatives into all individuals with violent 
        tendencies, naturally only to prevent them from committing violent crimes. 
        That's no concern of yours, is it? You're not a violent criminal. Or?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Just to give an example from a few years 
        ago: in 1984,<sup><a href="#FTNT1">(1)</a></sup> the computer at V&#228;rnpliktsverket 
        (the Swedish national military conscription administration) experienced 
        problems with the result that orders to report for rehearsal training 
        were not sent to all personnel that were obliged to do so. These people 
        received phone calls from authoritarian military officers that interrogated 
        them as to why they hadn't reported for duty. The authorities had received 
        information from a computer, presumed to be reliable, that orders to report 
        had in fact been sent. What's interesting here is not so much that a computer 
        could experience an error, but that it could really <i>control</i> a large 
        military organization. Some of our most respectable military institutions 
        therefore have names that could be used as product labels for various 
        computer brands.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, there's artificial intelligence. When 
        intelligent agents enter the picture, complexity increases. We may be 
        forced to ask ourselves if it's perhaps the case that we interact with 
        digital individuals, seemingly possessing their own free wills. A digital 
        individual is created when a computer system becomes so complex that it 
        gains a <i>consciousness</i>, similar to that of humans. This probably 
        hasn't happened yet at the time you read this. The most disturbing example 
        I can think of is a program from Hectare Ltd, which can generate trashy 
        novels for women, i. e. stuff similar to <b>Barbera Cartland</b>'s, in 
        a never-ending stream. If you ever suspected that a computer could generate 
        mainstream fiction, your fears have been realized. The program really 
        works, and it's not even very large and comprehensive. Similar programs 
        can reformulate pre-written passages to infuse them with a certain style 
        of writing.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the most dangerous power factors 
        with AI is that it can easily produce an endless flow of seemingly intelligent 
        bull, which diverts attention from real problems. To coin a conspiracy 
        theory, I'll propose that there are already publications whose content 
        is wholly or partially computer-generated. Those who wrote the programs 
        are probably mostly concerned with making money and don't care whatsoever 
        about the moral aspects. <i>Wouldn't you?</i> The public doesn't notice. 
        They think they see a human, but it's really a robot. But then again - 
        what's the difference? Curtains.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"> <img src="Image9.gif" width="507" height="136" border="1"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> This is just one of the many possible applications 
        of artificial intelligence. It is the case, however, that the digital 
        individual will one day become so intelligent that it can produce a dialog 
        without any input from one of the persons speaking. The established authorities 
        can then control the individual in any manner they choose. Imagine calling 
        the utility company about having no hot water. You think you're speaking 
        with a human, but you're actually talking to a computer. Everything you 
        say is turned into statistics, with no need for the responsible parties 
        to react to any criticism. The powers that be can filter out your complaints 
        in order to make independent, emotionally neutral decisions&#133; and 
        right about here the argument becomes so fuzzy that I might as well leave 
        it to the reader to finish. (I'm not really a philosopher, just a dabbler 
        in the art). It is at least an amusing thought experiment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#000000"><b>Cybernetic 
        Society vs. Copyright<br>
        </b></font><font face="Times New Roman">It is obvious that the cybernetic 
        social model entails changes in our way of viewing information and its 
        role in society. Some things that we now take for granted may become fundamentally 
        altered. An example: copyright. Copyright is the right to own information, 
        or in the case of a <i>patent</i>, the right to own knowledge and make 
        money from it. In jargon, it's called <i>intellectual property</i>. Copyright 
        was created in conjunction with the art of printing, since before that 
        time it wasn't very important to know who owned information and the right 
        to publish it. All knowledge and ideas were in those days considered public 
        domain, and not property. <i>Information was free</i>. Th possibility 
        of owning information is inseparable from the presence of machines like 
        the printing press, fax machines, or computers. Without these, the book, 
        painting, etc., become unique works of art as opposed to a mass of reproducible 
        information. Thus, copyright is an attribute of the early cybernetic society 
        that associates <i>information</i> and <i>knowledge</i> with <i>economy.</i> 
        This applies to all information, printed text or photographs, film or 
        software. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We can then trace the origin of copyright 
        to the emergence of the printed symbol. To emphasize the importance of 
        this development (in order to strengthen the argument), I will summarize 
        the development of modern symbols below:<br>

      </table>
      <p>T<font face="Times New Roman">he dates indicate the origin of the respective 
        symbol, rather than the date it became widely used. Normally, the transition 
        from oral to written culture is considered to have taken place around 
        500 B.C., and printed material wasn't very widespread before the Enlightenment 
        (1700s and 1800s). The first date is very hard to ascertain. This is really 
        not that important: the question is not one of dates, but of the history 
        of symbols. It is clear that information technology is causing a change 
        in society which effects are comparable to that of the printing press 
        (at least!).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Symbols change with time. What we consider 
        valuable today can become worthless tomorrow. For example, most people 
        think gold is valuable. If, let's say, a small planet made of gold collided 
        with the Earth, making gold the most common metal on the planet, our view 
        would instantly change to where gold was worth less than iron. By the 
        same token, we would gladly trade all of our gold for food if we were 
        starving, since we also have certain physical needs. You could even say 
        that we have psychological needs, which are (in our modern society) largely 
        generated by advertising, making us willing to trade our economic means, 
        in monetary form, for stereos, sodas, etc. We thus have a conception of 
        the value of things that is based on supply and demand. Supply and demand 
        are controlled partly by nature, and partly by other people. This is what 
        makes us consumers. These concepts are found in all major ideologies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When other people want to influence our 
        consumption, they use symbols to do so. This can be done by, for example, 
        establishing a certain brand of clothing as synonymous with the symbol 
        called <i>status</i>, or a brand of soda as synonymous with <i>freshness</i> 
        and <i>youthfulness</i>. But this is only the most conspicuous part of 
        the top of the iceberg.&nbsp;In reality, our entire societal system is 
        built by symbols. This is what sociologists cal <i>symbolic interactionism</i>, 
        which is a scientific theory usually associate with a guy named <b>George 
        Herbert Mead</b> - something of a genius of a philosopher, who unfortunately 
        didn't directly write anything, but had a great influence on the field 
        of sociology. Mead defined many of the symbols I've mentioned in this 
        chapter. Mead also touched upon the concepts that will be found later 
        on; among other things, he suggested that the French Revolution was a 
        turning point in modern history, where people for the first time realized 
        that they had a right to change or correct society, and that the state 
        wasn't based on some divine principle. Philosophically speaking, he was 
        a pragmatist who thought that ideas and theories should be checked against 
        reality before being awarded any value or authority. Mead for sure was 
        a supporter of the <i>hands-on imperative</i>. (The pragmatic school of 
        thought is an extension of fallibilism, which is basically the same as 
        Zen).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ok, fine. What about copyright, then? That's 
        the point I'm supposed to get to. We, as the people of the Earth, have 
        reached an agreement that says that we should view information and knowledge 
        as property. This concept of property, or ownership, is a <i>symbol</i> 
        that we endorse. With the introduction of the information society, the 
        <i>morality</i> created by these symbols becomes fuzzy, to say the least. 
        Morality, or ethics, tells you that you shouldn't trespass on the territory 
        of others, not to harm, not to steal someone else's property. These are 
        commonly accepted moral imperatives when it comes to material property. 
        But when it comes to <i>intellectual property</i>, protected by copyright 
        and patents, we've reached a breaking point. IT forces us to re-examine 
        these principles: it is <i>immoral</i> to enter certain commands in a 
        certain order from your keyboard. Other command sequences are fully acceptable. 
        I can program my own computer, but not someone else's over a network. 
        I am permitted to copy some programs as much as I want to, some not at 
        all, and some with conditions. We become uncertain of what to think, and 
        some succumb to dogmatic condemnation of software piracy, in order to 
        be certain.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since legislation isn't the same thing as 
        corporate policy, I get mixed signals, like when the gaming company Nintendo 
        asserted that it was forbidden to engage in second-hand sales of computer 
        games. Of course Nintendo is of this opinion, since if people can only 
        buy new games, that lets Nintendo sell more of them and make more money. 
        Under Swedish law, Nintendo doesn't have a leg to stand on. We are faced 
        with conflicting messages from the government and established industry, 
        with the result that we start thinking on our own. Since corporations 
        share economic power with governments, we view both as authorities. We 
        start questioning these authorities - we start thinking independently, 
        and make our own decisions in the absence of clear directives from society. 
        Remember, once again, Rule #3: <i>Distrust authority.</i> The hackers' 
        ethic leads the way through turbulent times.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The hackers discovered severe injustice 
        with regards to information. On the Scene, the 13-14-year-old hackers 
        couldn't for their life understand why only the youths with rich parents 
        should have access to all the fun software. Among the phreakers, there 
        was total disbelief over why only companies and institutions should be 
        allowed free communications - since this was a way to grow! Why accept 
        this? Granted, one could call this lack of respect and lack of understanding 
        of the workings of society, etc. However, no one lowered himself or herself 
        to discussing the issue. The message that the hackers received from the 
        establishment was: <i>&quot;You are criminals. Period.&quot;</i> What 
        amazing hypocrisy!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">I conclude that <i>the more cybernetic a 
        society becomes, the more difficult it becomes to define private domains 
        of knowledge.</i> The more computers and the more refined technology we 
        get, the more meaningless the concept of <i>intellectual property</i> 
        becomes. This is especially the case with software, for which patents 
        are granted for methods that didn't require any large investment in research 
        and equipment, but only perhaps one or two nights of intensive hacking. 
        The ideas didn't cost anything - it's mostly a case of &quot;early bird 
        gets the worm&quot;, and it gets the <i>only </i>worm. It is no longer 
        possible to defend intellectual injustice with material analogies.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This forces us to pose the question: where 
        is the line between freedom of expression and property? What may I copy 
        and what may I not copy? When does knowledge cease to be public property 
        and change into private property? What is happening is that technology 
        is de-boning our entire social systems, holding up its skeleton for all 
        to view. We can see how large areas of cyberspace has arbitrarily been 
        sold out to the profit-hungry gold diggers of the information industry.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Software is an extension of the human mind: 
        of the ability to create, understand, and generalize knowledge. To reserve 
        such a powerful tool only for those who can afford to burn hundreds of 
        dollars on it is not sustainable in the long term. I'm not saying that 
        parasites like the Chinese Triads or other piracy syndicates should be 
        allowed to take the right of ownership from the large companies. What 
        I <i>am</i> saying is that it shouldn't be prohibited for private individuals 
        to freely distribute software and help each other use it. This doesn't 
        exclude competition from established companies, as long as they can provide 
        something that the local hacker can't: printed manuals, 24-hour service, 
        instructional resources, etc. Who knows these things better than the one 
        who created the software? <i>Software is a product that lacks inherent 
        value</i>. It is not the ownership of software that drives society forward, 
        it is the ability to use it, and to teach others to use it. What we should 
        buy and sell in the information society isn't software, but applications 
        and advice - in one word: <i>Support</i>. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As necessary as copyright was in the industrial 
        society, as meaningless it is in the information society. The problem 
        is not separating printed information from electronic information. The 
        problem is that it's no longer possible to separate <i>information</i> 
        from <i>knowledge</i>, and <i>owned knowledge</i> from <i>public knowledge</i>. 
        The line between an <i>idea</i> and the <i>application</i> of the same 
        is being erased as people communicate more and more using machines that 
        have been constructed for that very purpose. By extension, the line between 
        <i>thought</i> and <i>action</i> is also threatened by the development 
        of virtual reality.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let the software companies fight syndicates, 
        mafias, and criminal groups that make a killing off piracy - this doesn't 
        bother me at all. But, for God's sake, don't condemn the private copying 
        of software between friends with no profit interests involved! This distribution 
        is <i>not</i> immoral, but simply a way of transmitting knowledge. It 
        is <i>wrong</i> if such copying is illegal, and it <i>should</i> be permitted 
        for private individuals to copy as much as they want. It is the <i>dirty 
        money</i> that should be removed from the software business, not the burning 
        interest and enthusiasm of the amateurs! The moral limit is not drawn 
        over the right to copy programs or not, but the right to <i>make money</i> 
        from a program or not! This is the right that should be reserved for the 
        author, if he or she so wishes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Sweden, today, I can go into any public 
        library, retrieve any book that I want, go to the copy machine and copy 
        as many pages as I want. Some legislator, in a moment of clarity, realized 
        that preventing this would be an infringement on the freedom of the individual 
        and the possibility of personal development *Code 1993:1007). Information 
        gives birth to intelligence! <i>There is no reason that this freedom should 
        be limited to printed matter.</i> Films, CDs, computer programs&#133; 
        it's only a matter of definition. All of this is information, and nourishment 
        for human intelligence. It is not healthy for the individual to be prevented 
        from copying information. It is sick. <i>SICK!</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Patenting a certain sequence of characters 
        - strings of information - sound waves and videograms - insanity. If the 
        people who first invented words for human language thought in those terms, 
        we would have never learned to read or write. Whistling a patented song 
        on the town square one sunny afternoon is a &quot;public broadcast&quot;, 
        and royalties should be paid for it. When you're not engaged in making 
        a profit off information - which is by extension to increase your power 
        - when you're simply out to spread joy and knowledge, then information 
        should be <i>free</i>. Period.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's no point in dragging out an argument 
        about it, and legislate left and right. Sooner or later, we'll reach the 
        <i>jaywalking</i> criteria (Translator's note: in Sweden, it's only illegal 
        to jaywalk if you end up actually interfering with traffic): this is when 
        a crime becomes so common and widespread that it's pointless to fight 
        it, like jaywalking or copying music CDs to tape. Rather, governments 
        and legislators should concern themselves with their own integrity.<sup><a href="#FTNT2">(2)</a></sup></font></p>

        Not Exist!)<br>
        </b>With the decreased clarity of our symbols, what should we expect to 
        happen? To have something to build on, I will with impunity borrow an 
        idea from <b>Thomas Kuhn</b>. Kuhn is a philosopher of science, who has 
        exciting ideas about the way science grows and changes over time. Kuhn's 
        theories are reminiscent of ideas of social development, the emergence 
        of various ideologies, and how we humans grow and change our environment 
        in general. In short: the man describes what happens when people use their 
        intelligence. The most thrilling part about Kuhns theories is that they 
        are very reminiscent of G&#246;del's theory of formal systems. The basic 
        premise is the following: you have a clear picture of the world, a <i>paradigm<sup><a href="#FTNT3">(3)</a></sup></i>, 
        such as:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">You know that information can be owned, 
          because otherwise this and that company would go bankrupt, and that 
          means this or that to you, which is not good, and therefore you should 
          accept that information can be owned. </font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Or:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"> You know that money is valuable since 
          it's based on the country's productivity and quality compared to other 
          countries, and therefore you should accept that a note with some numbers 
          on it is worth money, so that the government (and other governments) 
          doesn't suffer a crisis of public confidence, because then your standard 
          of living is threatened. (Note: slight sarcasm here. Other people might 
          say this in complete seriousness, though ;)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Kuhn thought that paradigms changed over 
        time like this:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> Paradigm -&gt; normal conditions -&gt; 
        Inconsistencies -&gt; Crisis -&gt; Revolution -&gt; New Paradigm</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">With the premise that people generally develop 
        norms (rules for action, bases for judgment) in the same way that scientists 
        form paradigms (models, bases for judgment), I'm applying this system 
        to our society. (Norms and paradigms are kind of the same - both are grounded 
        in human intelligence, and are oriented towards bringing order out of 
        chaos by erecting philosophical systems).&nbsp;These conceptual systems 
        live around us while we don't think about them. For example, there's no 
        law of nature that says we have to divide the day into 24 hours - we would 
        do just as well with 10 or 50. No one forced us to separate musical tones 
        into 12 per octave, because 8 or 16 would work fine too. We define our 
        environment in common terms to avoid conceptual confusion. Sometimes we 
        reflect on these concepts so rarely that we take them for granted, as 
        a natural order, and for that reason we consider people who come up with 
        new conceptual systems delusional. William S. Burroughs expresses this 
        more conspiratorially and ruthlessly:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><i>&quot;There is no true or real 'reality' - 'Reality' is simply a 
          more or less constant interpretive pattern - the pattern that we accept 
          as 'reality' has been forced upon us by the authorities of this planet, 
          a system of power that primarily seeks total control.&quot;</i></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">(From <i>Nova Express</i>)</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> When <b>Erik Satie</b>, the poor genius, 
        played his furniture music which broke with traditional patterns of musical 
        creation, he got booed out. When <b>Picasso</b> broke with classical art 
        concepts, many considered him to be an idiot. Cross your heart - how many 
        of you has <i>not</i> at some point complained about art which <i>&quot;you 
        can't see what it's supposed to be&quot;</i>? G&#246;del went so far as 
        to prove that even something like <i>time</i> is subjectively perceived, 
        philosopher or not. With hackers, we find this rebelliousness in, for 
        example, the B1FF language, where our pre-established notions of the functions 
        of signs are given a serious twist. Many BBS and Internet users write 
        flaming posts when they see someone write a sentence like: y0YO!#%$!! 
        wH4+zZ h4pP3n1n' 4r0uN '3r3 +H3zZ3 d4yZzZ?#$!%??. The question repeats 
        itself: <i>how groundbreakingly creative are you allowed to be?</i> And 
        at which points in time?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">From the start, after some turbulent times 
        we've established a closed conceptual system that we have accepted, we 
        live in a stable condition where production and consumption live in harmony 
        with an established societal system, with all that it brings of class 
        divisions and territorial thinking. Now, when the information society 
        brings things to a head, internal inconsistencies emerge inside the system. 
        Is money really based on production? What are the production forces, in 
        that case? Can knowledge be owned or not? This is the period in which 
        our society currently finds itself, and will remain in for quite some 
        time. This is the turbulent era of the <i>post-industrial society</i>. 
        We are breaking out of the complete, near-mathematical system that our 
        society has been stuck in, almost like G&#246;del broke out of mathematical 
        systems and Zen debunks philosophical theories with direct answers. The 
        <i>Patriarchy</i>, which the feminists want to break down, is another 
        system whose foundations are cracking. (Within sociological science, this 
        condition is called <i>anomie</i>, which means that there is a lack of 
        functioning norms in society, like in today's post-Soviet Russia). This 
        phase is also characterized by mushrooming subcultures and a reinforcement 
        in religious sects, both of which are a result of an anxious search for 
        definite norms not found in ordinary society. Eventually, there will be 
        a <i>crisis</i> that precedes the <i>real</i> information revolution. 
        This is when the most comprehensive societal changes will take place. 
        (We are talking about a social revolution, no necessarily a bloody one). 
        After this revolution, we form a new set of assumptions about how society 
        should function, and it is only then that we have achieved the real information 
        society. Many micro- and macroeconomic equations (or <i>axioms</i>, to 
        be scientifically nit-picky) that are valid in the industrial society 
        will become totally worthless in the information society.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In order for the changes to occur at all, 
        someone has to push them through, committed to partially tearing down 
        old norms to make room for new ones, albeit with some respect for the 
        old society. These are Nietzsche's disciples, or in our case, the most 
        militant cyberpunks with the hackers at the front, who dare to stand for 
        their ideals in a new age. To quote Nietzsche himself: <i>&quot;I'm not 
        closed-minded enough to stick to only one system, not even my own!&quot;</i> 
        It's about tearing down the norms of industrial society to make way for 
        the ones that will put information society on track. It doesn't have to 
        occur outside the established system; what Nietzsche (and others) says 
        is that it <i>may</i>. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since the 50's and 60's, the younger generation 
        has assumed the role as pattern-breakers, questioning old systems and 
        building new ones. In Nietzsche's time, students and intellectuals were 
        the most rebellious. There's been a shift to where radical ideas are associated 
        with youth, and conservative ideas with age. This is one of the worst 
        pathologies of our system of roles - many young people actually dislike 
        the role as revolutionaries, and become, like in <b>Tom Petty</b>'s partially 
        self-biographical song <i>Into The Great Wide Open</i>, rebels without 
        a clue. The pressure to revolt can in some cases become the straw that 
        breaks the camel's back, pushing youngsters into crime and drug abuse. 
        Many acts of rebellion are unfounded and arbitrary, aimed solely at provoking 
        more conservative older folks - but there are some acts that <i>are</i> 
        justified. The revolt against the informational dictatorship of corporations 
        and governments is not unreasonable. It is an ideologically grounded revolution, 
        which deserves being taken seriously.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Tolerance for new concepts and points of 
        view is one factor that determines how closed or streamlined a society 
        is. Nietzsche, in his time, appreciated the majestic music of <b>Richard 
        Wagner</b>, which was another attempt to break out of a degenerating musical 
        paradigm. Even though Hitler later admired both Wagner and Nietzsche, 
        nazism was an ideology that condemned any effort to create new systems 
        of concepts. Towards the end of the 30'', they organized an exposition 
        in Berlin for &quot;ugly&quot; art, mostly modern, which they considered 
        sick or twisted. That's the nature of fascism: after a shining ascension, 
        it loses all interest in creativity and strives only to preserve itself. 
        Can a society like ours, with corporations large enough to intimidate 
        governments, accept an orderly and reasonable debate about the existence 
        of copyright? Or will the system violently seize the power to decide what 
        is public and private property, bypassing pesky democratic channels through 
        lobbying and executive decrees with no debate whatsoever?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear readers: I suppose that on your journey 
        through this book, you've discovered how close we really are to the information 
        society.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's my honest and upright opinion that 
        such a society will either be free of copyright and software patents as 
        they exist today, or it will be an informational dictatorship run by either 
        governments, corporations, or mafias. The latter is the society William 
        Gibson warns us of in his cyberpunk novels. Let's avoid it. I have do 
        not know exactly how this change will occur, nor what the final result 
        will be, just that it <i>will</i> take place.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>Cybernetic Society vs. Class Perspectives 
        - The Mechanisms of Power<br>
        </b>The British sociologist <b>Basil Bernstein</b><sup><a href="#FTNT4">(4)</a></sup><b> 
        </b>viewed the mechanisms of society like this:</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"> <img src="Image10.gif" width="310" height="234" border="1"> 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> In this system, we can see society divided 
        into a production sphere and a sociocultural reproduction sphere. In the 
        <i>production sphere</i> (corporations, organizations, legislature, executive 
        branch, and counties), <b>power</b> is created, economic, political, and 
        public. The <i>socio-cultural reproduction sphere</i> (parts of the media, 
        entertainment industry, educational system, etc.) exists to justify and 
        perpetuate the patterns suitable to the production sphere.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the bottom of the picture, we find the 
        nexus of these relationships. The <b>Code</b> is our language, in all 
        its forms. It's actually every social symbol used to exchange information 
        between people and society. The <b>Code</b> is <i>pure information. </i>It 
        is the foundation for the entire hierarchy and social order. Through the 
        linguistic code, society is constantly structured and reinforced in the 
        same ways, which is why Zen, Nietzsche and Burroughs criticized language 
        - they felt subordinated to a social and cognitive system which never 
        changed in any substantial manner. Additionally, language has more levels 
        than the spoken or written. There is pictorial language, music, and all 
        kinds of symbols to use. Basically, all vessels for the transfer and storage 
        of information could be said to be part of this code.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many believe that the information society 
        will naturally generate the same kind of structure, just because it's 
        always happened before. There is no evidence suggesting that this would 
        be the case - rather, evidence suggests the opposite. The information 
        society inherently elevates public consciousness of society itself to 
        a level which bares its mechanisms. What's actually happening is that 
        the basic units of society become aware of their own role in this gigantic 
        information system, which in turn leads to their desire to improve it. 
        Social progress can thus be further accelerated, like always (you with 
        me?).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's employ an illustrative example: a 
        current controversy on the Internet concerns (as I mentioned in Chapter 
        8) the Church of Scientology and its questionable copyright on the religious 
        documents it produces. According to believers, the documents contain material 
        describing the movement's so-called <i>clearing technology</i>, which 
        is a quasi-science demanding comprehensive and very expensive courses. 
        The Church thinks that only members of the movement have a right to this 
        information. Roughly, you could say that clearing technology consists 
        of hypnosis and science fiction. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Church of Scientology is a sect, and 
        as such, a society within society. It provides all the functions a society 
        normally provides for a human being. It affords her opinions, morality, 
        social orientation, and so on. The only reason for a member to venture 
        outside the limits of the sect, is to earn his or her own living and thereby 
        nourishing the sect also. Sects, among which I also place the Plymouth 
        Rock people, Jehova's Witnesses, and Livets Ord (a Swedish religious sect), 
        live like parasites on our social system. Almost every clear-headed individual 
        is aware of this. One way of seeing how hermetically closed a sect is, 
        is to apply Bernstein's model on it. Any reader with some imagination 
        shouldn't have much trouble doing this.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, participate in a thought experiment 
        that is taboo. Imagine that society is a sect, and that your thought patterns 
        are externally controlled. Imagine that copyright and freedom-of-expression 
        legislation exists to limit your awareness and maintain the social hierarchy, 
        just like a sect's leadership rules its members. Imagine that, despite 
        all of our freedoms, we might be blinded by the delusion that our society 
        is free! Members of a sect are completely convinced that they have made 
        an independent choice to join it, and that they are free individuals. 
        All sect members are convinced that the sect's account of things is the 
        one true account, and all renegades are vehicles of, for example, Satan. 
        Suppose that all members of society are convinced that society's account 
        of reality is the true one, and that criminals, hackers, and other non-conformists 
        are painted in a bad light because it suits its purposes. No sect leaders 
        force their members to obey and serve out of sheer lust for power, but 
        because they actually believe in what they're doing. No politician or 
        CEO forces citizens and employees to do their bidding out of sheer malice, 
        because they also believe in what they're doing. Do you understand Burroughs 
        a little more?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Look society and power in the eye. Why is 
        the Church of Scientology one of the first authorities to cry for law 
        and order, wanting control of information? Why is society not so far behind? 
        Why do we want to keep tabs on the information that spreads through subcultures? 
        Suppose that there are truths you never dreamt of, outside the universe 
        of society. Isn't it the case that behind this jovial fa&#231;ade of the 
        social community a force is concealed, which wants to replace organic 
        sympathy with mechanical obedience?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">So what is this superior power? I've already 
        shown what it is: supervisory intelligent entities, thinking units consisting 
        of constructs of people: Corporations, Governments, Nations, Counties, 
        Concerns, Mafias&#133;. they consist of individuals, but they don't <i>think</i> 
        like individuals. They are intelligent, but their intelligence is not 
        human. They can benefit us, but they can also do us harm. They are <i>superindividuals</i>, 
        individuals made out of individuals, united through the control of information, 
        or to put it in another way: <i>power</i>. The problem is that we, as 
        humans, have a horrible time seeing the forest for the trees.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Too many myths are flourishing around people 
        and their society. One of the most despicable ones is the delusion that 
        society is &quot;free&quot;. Every society is founded on the <i>lack </i>of 
        freedom - giving up some of your freedom in exchange for security. What 
        every individual should know is that unless you apply anarchistic principles, 
        you have to go through life constantly sacrificing parts of your freedom 
        to superior forces. These can consist of the kinds I enumerated above, 
        and others. The basic obligation a superindividual has to an individual 
        is to inform the individual that <i>&quot;this is what I claim of your 
        freedom, and this is what you get in exchange.&quot;</i> Symbiosis, not 
        domination. The nastiest of these superindividuals are those that operate 
        behind the scenes, intentionally controlling and influencing individuals 
        without their knowledge. These are often referred to under a collective 
        term: the &quot;Illuminati&quot;, the glowing ones, the &quot;good&quot; 
        people, the circle of initiates.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Look at a new world with open eyes. Break 
        out of the system. Only after doing so, can you understand what you can 
        do for society. (And don't forget to ask yourself if I am, in fact, just 
        a nutty conspiracy theorist trying to see something where nothing exists. 
        That possibility exists, you know.) </font></p>

      <font color="#666666"><a name="FTNT1"></a> 1. Wasn't it an exquisite coincidence 
      for this incident to happen in 1984?<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT2"></a> 2. Here's a present for the libertarians: if the right 
      of ownership is sacred, why do people not respect it when it comes to music 
      CDs, etc.? Would you? <i>Why</i> is the market unable to solve this problem, 
      if the legislature is really so powerless? Say, are there any problems that 
      can't be solved either by the market or the state?<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT3"></a> 3. This word is one of those that have escaped down 
      from the esoteric, academic levels into normal language. Be careful if you 
      use it around people with scientific training, since the keyword of science 
      is <i>precision</i> - paradigm means one specific thing, not a category. 
      Using the word outside the philosophy of science could be viewed as a vulgar, 
      though common, practice. The opposite of scientific language is found in 
      New Age culture, where it's important to be as fuzzy and imprecise as possible. 
      Popular culture, of which this book is an example, must attempt a balancing 
      act between these two extremes.<br>

      <a name="FTNT4"></a> 4. Bernstein, who was originally a linguist, belongs 
      to some structuralist or post-structuralist school of thought, which isn't 
      really too important in this context.</font></td>
