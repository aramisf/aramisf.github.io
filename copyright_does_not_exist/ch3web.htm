        of hacker culture consisted of amateur radio and electronics hobbyists, 
        who built their own microcomputers using the very first mail-order kits. 
        Radio amateurs have been around since 1915, and they are organized in 
        several camps. The most puritan insist that the telegraph key and Morse 
        code are still the best tools for international communication. Others 
        prefer radio telephony, i.e. voice transmissions. Still others have tried 
        amateur TV, and some fiddle around with data communication by radio. Radio 
        amateurs are found in any city worth its name, and many have turned to 
        data transfer through the Internet, where they explore yet another means 
        of communication. In a sense, the radio enthusiasts became the first hackers, 
        even before MIT.</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">The radio amateurs, as 
        opposed to the hackers, seldom attracted young people to any great extent. 
        In Sweden, part of the reason is that you have to be sixteen years old 
        and become certified to use shortwave radios. The average Swedish youth 
        can't afford the courses and testing required for radio certification. 
        Some mess around with radio anyway, and are known as radio pirates. Broadcasting 
        amateur radio without certification is not a big deal, as long as you 
        don't cause problems. You have to be careful to stick to the correct frequencies; 
        broadcasting on bands that are reserved for specific purposes, such as 
        emergency or military channels, carries a risk of being traced and fined. 
        </font><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">To keep track of what frequencies 
        to use to avoid trouble, radio amateurs soon began cooperating internationally. 
        This became the first </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><i>virtual 
        society</i></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">, which transcended 
        geographic boundaries but was limited by technology.<br>
        </font> </p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">Radio amateurs embody 
        a great deal of the culture that would later be adopted by the hackers: 
        a fascination with technology (machines), and a fascination with interpersonal 
        communication. Some are constantly on the lookout for new, cool equipment 
        (gadget freaks). Others only want to find ways to communicate with other 
        people as efficiently as possible, and try to improve existing systems 
        (evolutionists), and some feel that they've mastered an aspect of technology 
        and simply stay with it (these are sometimes called conservatives). Finally, 
        there are those that most amateurs do not want anything to do with: the 
        people that think that broadcasting pirate radio is the most awesome thing 
        in the world, and who use technology as a means of rebelling against society.</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">The early computer-oriented 
        electronics hobbyists initially gathered around the very first personal 
        computer: the </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Altair 8800</b></font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">, which was introduced as a mail-order 
        kit in 1975. The computer got its name from a planet in a Star Trek episode, 
        and sold in such large quantities that some of the enthusiasts formed 
        their own user groups. They were invariably electronics hobbyists, and 
        often professional engineers. Virtually all of them were adults, but they 
        were struck by the same technical fascination with programming that kept 
        the university hackers awake all night and made them forget everything 
        but the machines. </font><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">The most 
        active user group was the </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Homebrew 
        Computer Club</b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> in San Fransisco. 
        One of its members was </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Steve 
        Wozniak</b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">, a dedicated hacker 
        who was to build the </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Apple 
        II</b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> computer. His friend 
        </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Steve Jobs</b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> 
        successfully marketed it in 1977 as the first real personal computer.</font><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;Homebrew 
        Computer Club's Swedish counterpart was called </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>PD68</b></font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">, which catered to happy engineers 
        and others who found microcomputers fascinating.<br>
        </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Personal Computers for 
        a Broad Market<br>
        </b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">In 1978, the Swedish companies 
        Luxor and Scandia Metric contracted with </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Data 
        Industrier AB</b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> (DIAB) to 
        build a computer called </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>ABC80</b></font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">. DIAB manufactured the chips, while 
        Luxor built the case, monitor, and keyboard. Despite its monochrome display 
        (which required a special monitor), the ABC80 was a quality machine. As 
        with its contemporaries Apple II and Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80, the established 
        American computer industry considered these computers virtually useless. 
        IBM displayed no interest whatsoever. The current trend was toward manufacturing 
        minicomputers such as Digital Equipment's enormous DEC, since the industry 
        giants (spearheaded by IBM and Digital) projected a global need for about 
        50 large computers in the year 2000. Users would connect to these computers 
        through terminal networks.</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">It is unclear what prompted 
        Luxor and Scandia Metric to produce a computer for the regular consumer. 
        Most likely, the chief engineers observed personal computing trends in 
        the U.S., where the Apple II and TRS-80 had entered mass-production, and 
        somehow persuaded the management to approve such a venture.</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">ABC80 became a great success 
        among Sweden's early computer enthusiasts, who had been waiting a long 
        time for a real computer (previous computers had been very expensive and 
        directly imported from the U.S.). Now there was one - and to top it off, 
        it was Swedish! In 1981, it was succeeded by the ABC800. </font><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">In 
        1980, electronics hobbyists, engineers, and other enthusiasts formed </font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><i>ABC-klubben </i></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">(the 
        ABC Club) under the leadership of the legendary </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Gunnar 
        Tidner</b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">. The ABC Club showed 
        an interest in computer communications from the start, and at the end 
        of that year it opened </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><i>Monitorn</i></font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> (The Monitor), which probably was 
        Sweden's first non-profit BBS. It ran thanks to a program written by Tidner 
        himself. For the rest of the 80's, most new Swedish BBS's were named </font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><i>X-Monitorn</i></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> 
        (such as &#214;rebro-Monitorn, Eskilstuna-Monitorn, etc.) as a tribute 
        to Tidner's breakthrough. The club still has a &quot;monitor&quot; that's 
        used as an internal switchboard for all kinds of things.</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">The ABC Club grew exponentially 
        as personal computing in Sweden became all the rage it was in the U.S. 
        It became a center for debating the technology of ABC computers as well 
        as data communications in general. In 1985, through a contract with the 
        QZ Computer Center in Stockholm, the ABC club gained access to a DEC-10 
        computer. On this machine, the members started a central BBS (a &quot;real&quot; 
        conferencing system) with several discussion groups. The BBS, named </font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><i>Q-Zentralen</i></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> 
        (The Q-Zentral) ran on QZ's KOM-system, and resembled past and present 
        networks such as U.S.A.'s Usenet and Prodigy, or England's Compunet.</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">Many of the pioneers of 
        the future electronic Sweden were found on Q-Zentral's discussion groups: 
        </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Sven Wickberg, Anders Franz&#233;n, 
        Henrik Schyffert, </b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">and</font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b> Jan-Inge Fl&#252;cht.<br>
        </b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">It was not until the early 
        80's, after the introduction of small, cheap computers, that any real 
        changes in personal computing took place. It was no longer necessary to 
        know how to build your own equipment; therefore, anyone who could afford 
        it could have access to their own computer (albeit not very advanced). 
        Overnight, an array of personal computers appeared, in the U.S. as well 
        as Europe: Sord, Atari 800, Sol, Texas TI-99A, Vic-20, Spectravideo, etc. 
        Most remained on the market for only a few years before production was 
        halted and/or their manufacturers went bankrupt. </font><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">In 
        Sweden, only three survived the competition: </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Sinclair 
        ZX-80</b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> (thanks to its low 
        price), </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>ABC-80</b></font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> (because of its industrial applications 
        and strong support from the ABC-Club), and </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Commodore 
        64 </b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">(which will be referred 
        to as the </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>C64</b></font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">), simply because it was the most 
        technologically advanced home computer of the time. Even the first PC's 
        hit the market in early 1981, but they commanded such exorbitant prices 
        that no normal person would consider them personal computers. In America, 
        the </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Apple II, Atari 800, 
        Commodore PET, </b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">and</font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b> C64</b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> 
        were the main survivors. Apple II, in particular, was to the U.S. as the 
        ABC-80 was to Sweden. To this day, there are resilient Apple II-fanatics 
        who still use their late 70's computers, just like Sweden has its resilient 
        ABC-80 users (some of which make up the heart of the ABC80 Club).</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">Initially, most European 
        hackers were of the same kind as the American ones: old radio amateurs, 
        engineers, or electronics enthusiasts who dreamed of using a </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><i>real 
        </i></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">computer such as VAX or 
        IBM (those lovely, gray, refrigerator-looking things) instead of simple 
        home computers. The hacker culture from MIT in the 60's, and its extension 
        of the radio amateurs' philosophy, were considered an ideal; a real hacker 
        was a person who wrote programs that did something useful (or appeared 
        to do something useful), or who had mastered electronics and could modify 
        their computer to the amazement of their friends. The most fortunate computer 
        clubs had been able to start their own BBS's on a used minicomputer purchased 
        from some company. The hackers that had gotten started on ABC80, minicomputers, 
        and electronics were generally shocked and somewhat disgusted by the culture 
        that emerged in the mid-80's through the invasion of the C64 (this will 
        be discussed in the chapter 5, </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><i>Subculture 
        of the Subcultures</i></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">). Many 
        of those hackers have now obtained a PC, and consider writing shareware 
        programs and other real &quot;hacks&quot; to be a noble art.</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">Hackers of this sort also 
        started the alternative computer network </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><i>Fidonet</i></font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">. In San Francisco, amateurs </font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Tom Jennings</b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> 
        and </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>John Madill</b></font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> devised a system in which different 
        BBS's called each other according to a specific pattern, and through skillful 
        coordination managed to provide coverage as broad as the Internet's. The 
        main difference was that electronic mail had longer delivery times, and 
        there were no permanent connections; the mail was distributed through 
        substations, just like in an old-fashioned postal system. The network 
        also allowed for globally accessible discussion groups. In the beginning 
        of 1985, the Swedish Fidonet was started in Karlstad by </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><b>Conny 
        Johnsson</b></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">Because of the increased 
        affordability of the Internet, many think that Fidonet has become obsolete. 
        Far from everyone agrees - Fidonet is a true amateur creation, while the 
        Internet has mainly been constructed by academicians. However, for a long 
        time there have been bridges connecting the two networks, enabling their 
        respective users to send mail to each other. </font><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">Personal 
        computing became a public concept, and many teenagers received their first 
        computer in the mid-80's. Most futuristic parents who bought a computer 
        probably hadn't expected their children to spend as much time on the computer 
        as they did, but this was a result of a marketing glitch. Personal computers 
        were marketed as office systems to be used for financial, word processing, 
        and database applications, for all of which they turned out to be quite 
        useless. Apparently, it was simpler to find a recipe in a cookbook than 
        to boot up the computer and look through some database which took five 
        minutes to load. The only &quot;useful&quot; tasks that the machines could 
        perform efficiently were word processing and simple calculations, which 
        was something that few people were familiar with or could appreciate.</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">The only adults who really 
        used their computers were almost exclusively technicians or technology 
        fans, who could stay up all night and fight with their ABC80 to make it 
        do one thing or another. Many were electronics hobbyists that modified 
        the computer to suit their own wants and needs. (I belong to the wave 
        of youths who were completely captured by the ABC computers around 13 
        or 14 years of age; for many in my generation, those machines became a 
        ticket to the electronic world).</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">It would be until the 
        90's before the personal computer really got its breakthrough as a popular 
        appliance - but when it came, it came with a vengeance. It is only recently 
        that IBM PC's have become common in the home. If it hadn't been for the 
        Altair 8800, Apple II, Atari 800, and ABC80, it would never even have 
        occurred to IBM to manufacture PC's. The previous trend had been toward 
        building mainframes: mammoth boxes that consumed several kilowatts per 
        hour, and generated so much heat that they needed a separate cooling system 
        to be able to operate. The idea of one computer for each user </font> 
        <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><i>was and remains</i></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"> 
        a hacker's notion, which goes all the way back to MIT, where many late 
        nights were spent working alone on a PDP-1.</font></p>
      <p align=left><font size=3 face="Times New Roman">Had these microcomputers 
        not emerged, the industry would still be working on their 50 supercomputers 
        that were to provide computing power for the entire world. Without the 
        microcomputer, modern information systems such as the </font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman"><i>Client-Server 
        </i></font> <font size=3 face="Times New Roman">model (in which a coordinated 
        network of computers distribute tasks and information between them) would 
        never have been invented.</font> </p>
