      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>During the 80's</b>, something strange 
        occurred in Sweden. The DJ's that had grown up in the seventies (and were 
        intended as replacements for the grossly expensive and uncontrollable 
        live music) suddenly acquired artistic ambitions. Small companies in the 
        form of a mix between record companies and DJ houses started appearing 
        all over the Western world. They produced records containing music for 
        one single purpose - to be played at discos and dance clubs. It should 
        be as rhythmic as possible, and at a rate of about 120 beats per minute 
        - a perfect pace for dancing. <b>Swemix</b> and <b>Nordic Beats</b> were 
        companies that were typical of Sweden. Among the DJ's who became successes 
        by combining dance and pop music were <b>Robert W&#229;tz</b> and <b>Rasmus 
        Lindvall</b>, later known as <b>Rob n' Raz</b>, and they were most famous 
        for adapting tracks from the rock group <b>Electric Boys</b> to the dance 
        floor. Others preferred to stay less commercial and do <i>their own thing</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the middle and end of the 80's, and 
        in Sweden in particular in 1987-88, the new dance culture emerged. It 
        was careless and carefree dancing for its own sake, nothing well-organized 
        and tidy that you subjected yourself to for social reasons at discos or 
        in physical education classes, but rather wild, uninhibited dancing. It 
        was the resurrection of the rhythmic, ritualistic dance that had for centuries 
        remained repressed and subjugated by the West's religious and ethical 
        values, and it returned in the form of <i>acid house</i>. Naturally, established 
        society, with its politicians, musicians, and counselors, was outraged 
        and terrified. And naturally, all the young people with enough brains 
        to be rebellious bought acid house records to freak out their parents 
        (including your author, who bought his first acid record, <i>House Nation</i> 
        by <b>MBO</b>, in 1987).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Pure <i>house</i> was the most successful 
        in the beginning, probably because it was based on funk, soul, and disco 
        music a la George Clinton and James Brown rather than synthetic music. 
        The synthetic parts were limited to some bass line, generated by a drum 
        machine or stolen outright from some Kraftwerk record. The style was created 
        in Chicago, and supposedly derived its name from the fact that dance parties 
        were often held in warehouses (one of the first European house music clubs 
        was thereafter named <b>Warehouse</b>, and was located in K&#246;ln, West 
        Germany). Together with the contemporary Detroit-based <i>techno</i> genre 
        (which was purely electronic), this new dance music came to be called 
        <i>acid house</i>. Early house bands include <b>The Royal House</b>, the 
        previously named <b>MBO</b>, and <b>D-Mob</b>. When the music gained in 
        popularity, the two styles became mixed together, particularly in Europe 
        where it was simply called <i>acid</i>, and no one really knew what music 
        belonged to what style. The first really influential European house clubs 
        appeared around Manchester, England.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Acid house was a special form of dance music 
        which used <i>samples</i> (fragments of sounds) in specific ways. It was 
        inspired by the cacophony of machine sounds employed by industrial music 
        (as with <b>Throbbing Gristle</b> or <b>Einst&#252;rzende Neubauten</b>), 
        William S. Burroughs' style of building larger texts from small text fragments 
        (read more about him in the next chapter), and from the art of collage 
        and mosaic. The acid musicians constructed a mosaic of sound phrases, 
        and were almost exclusively DJ's who knew how to emphasize good dance 
        rhythms. You could say that it was the first instance of <i>concrete music</i> 
        (the brainchild of Pierre Schaeffer) reaching a wide audience. Sampling 
        machines were first introduced among musicians engaged in making concrete 
        music.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Musically speaking, acid house developed 
        the already existing electro-pop trend of well-composed riffs, in the 
        form of synthetically generated loops that set the mood and ambience of 
        the song. &quot;Acid&quot; is unfortunately also a slang term for lysergic 
        acid-25 (LSD). Acid house has, however, probably not derived its name 
        from any such association. It has been said that the true originator of 
        the term is the slang expression &quot;burn acid&quot;, which was DJ jargon 
        and referred to the sampling sounds from records. There are, of course, 
        others who say that this is just a euphemistic lie, and that the term 
        originated from a few English musicians who visited Detroit around 1986, 
        buying anything with the word &quot;acid&quot; on it in the search for 
        Grateful Dead and other &quot;hippie&quot; recordings, but instead ended 
        up with a slew of strange synthesized music which turned out to be early 
        techno and house. The name for the genre supposedly emerged from this 
        event.&nbsp;Acid house also has a characteristic sound, a little heavier 
        and faster than regular dance music, but milder than the &quot;raw synth&quot; 
        mentioned earlier. Sounds from synthesizers and drum machines such as 
        <b>Roland 303, 707, 808, and 909</b> were especially popular (hence, for 
        example, the house group <b>808 State</b>).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Acid music gained popularity at the time 
        of the golden age of personal computers. 1987-88-89 are considered the 
        absolutely most intense years of the early history of personal computing 
        culture, which is why many demos, pseudonyms, and group names among the 
        subcultural hackers drew inspiration from acid house. The two cultures 
        rest on the same cultural base of amateurs, and emerged thanks to the 
        increased availability of low-cost computers and consumer electronics 
        during the same period. Also note a vague influence of hacker culture 
        on acid musicians: DJ's with names like <b>Phuture</b> or <b>Phusion</b> 
        (if you observe the spelling) have obviously been inspired by hackers. 
        Acid house also formed a kind of symbolism for youth rebellion during 
        these years.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">There has long existed a total conceptual 
        confusion eith respect to dance music. Acid house grew explosively into 
        a number of sub-categories; every larger city in England and Germany seemed 
        to develop its own house genre, with the same trend taking place in the 
        US. Many quickly tired of the eternal compromises between electronic dance 
        music and the verse-refrain style of rock music, or rap (which was mandatory 
        within hip-hop), and reverted to the original and purely electronic dance 
        music: <i>techno</i>.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Techno</b><br>
        Techno sought to return to the roots of electronic pop music - the sounds 
        and harmonies used in regular dance music had grown tiresome, and acid 
        house had started sounding the same across the board. Acid was no longer 
        breaking new ground, and it was time for something new. DJ's who were 
        now full-fledged electronic musicians sat through their nights listening 
        to <b>Kraftwerk, Ultravox, D.A.F. </b>(<b>Deutsche-Amerikanische Freundschaft</b>) 
        and other early synth bands that had contributed to music culture, in 
        an attempt to find the good stuff that had been left behind and at the 
        same time try to create something new. And they succeeded, especially 
        by using early synthesizers such as <b>Prophet</b>, <b>Fairlight</b>, 
        and <b>Roland</b> brands. The reason for this return to yesterday's technology 
        was supposedly that they couldn't really afford anything else.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Techno was, as noted earlier, born in Detroit. 
        The origin of the entire genre can be traced to three DJ's named <b>Magic</b> 
        (Juan Atkins), <b>Reese</b> (Kevin Saunderon), and <b>Mayday</b> (Derrik 
        May). They claim to have been inspired especially by Kraftwerk and <b>Parliament</b> 
        (George Clinton). Mayday toured England in 1987 and provided inspiration 
        for the underground acid scene through his compositions. Most likely, 
        this legendary DJ has lent his name to the enormous <i>Mayday</i> rave, 
        which is held annually in Germany and has reached astronomical proportions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Frankfurt had early on become inspired by 
        Detroit techno and created its own version, <i>eurotechno</i>, by trashing 
        their Japanese synthesizers and hunting down old relics from the seventies. 
        <b>SNAP</b> invented the winning combination of a black rapper and a female 
        vocalist, and <b>LA Style</b> made a loud and provocative song called 
        <i>James Brown is Dead</i>, to signify the end of techno's affair with 
        funk and R&amp;B. Groups like <b>2 Unlimited, Pandora, Captain Hollywood 
        Project, </b>and<b> Culture Beat</b> fall under the collective term <i>eurodance</i> 
        (in the US, this genre is called <i>techno/rave</i>).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">These and other early eurotechno bands brought 
        something new that many had long been waiting for. They abandoned the 
        120 bpm that had been the mark of beauty for acid house, and pushed the 
        pace of their songs to a level that most closely resembled energetic punk. 
        The tempo increased on dance floors around the world at the same time 
        that MTV grew really large and further expanded the production of popular 
        culture. We ended up with a new, wearied youth generation which was called 
        <i>Generation X</i>, who walked out of movie theaters if nothing had happened 
        by the first ten minutes of the film.<br>
        At the same time, the indefinable <b>KLF</b> (Kopyright Liberation Front) 
        appeared from nowhere and toured the hit lists with only one album and 
        an incredible amount of singles, only to later withdraw from the scene 
        and, in their own words, &quot;never again make music&quot;. The group 
        consisted of <b>Bill Drummond</b>, the disillusioned former manager of 
        (among others) <i>Echo and the Bunnymen</i>, and <b>Jimmy Cauty</b>, a 
        former member of <i>Killing Joke.</i> They introduced a totally new element 
        to popular music by combining the instrumentation and dance-oriented tempo 
        of dance music with classical rock formulations. The result was music 
        palatable to synth, techno and rock fans.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">KLF were very aware of what they were doing. 
        In the early stages of their career, they wrote a book titled <i>The Manual</i>, 
        and promised a full refund to anyone who could not make it to England's 
        hit list with the help of the book. Before they became KLF they called 
        themselves <b>The Timelords </b>and<b> The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu</b> 
        (a name which together with much of KLF's image is taken from the cult 
        book <i>Illuminatus</i>!). In reality, you should probably consider KLF's 
        commercial career as an example of modern art making a protest against 
        the pop industry. At the end of their career, they actually hated this 
        self-perpetuating machine that churned out the same garbage over and over 
        again. Throughout their career, the group was characterized by a total 
        lack of respect for money and established pop music, as well as a generally 
        cynical view of life. The leader, Drummond, was highly inspired by Zen 
        Buddhism, and provoked those who posed questions about the band by accusing 
        them of being under the influence of the four mistresses of Lucifer: <i>Why, 
        What, Where, </i>and<i> When,</i> which are questions that according to 
        Zen cannot be answered by words. Early on, Drummond worked with Alex Paterson 
        on <i>The Orb</i>, and the two together could be said to have invented 
        the genre of <i>ambient techno</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">KLF also clearly shows the connection between 
        attitudes in the underground dance culture and among hackers. As many 
        other DJ's, they sampled extensively from other artists, and more or less 
        held the opinion that music should not be patented. On one occasion they 
        sampled ABBA and wrote (somewhat provocatively) on the back of the album 
        that &quot;<i>KLF hereby declares all material on this record free of 
        copyright</i>&quot;, which eventually resulted in the entire issue being 
        burned on a field somewhere in central Sweden. This took place after KLF 
        failed to convince ABBA to withdraw their threat of legal action that 
        they received from ABBA's Swedish representatives. On another occasion, 
        Drummond began to &quot;liberate&quot; the group's equipment during a 
        gig at a London club, which forced the club owners to intervene to stop 
        the guests from taking the machines home with them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In England, there is a whole array of strange 
        musicians in addition to KLF: among others, the ambient music revolutionaries 
        <b>Black Dog Productions</b> and an idiosyncratic group named <b>The Prodigy</b>, 
        who invented their own style of music called <i>breakbeat</i>. These groups, 
        like KLF, appeared in the late 80's in synch with various independent 
        bands such as <i>Pop Will Eat Itself</i>. The explosive development of 
        the music business in England was due to the very pop industry that KLF 
        specifically protested.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A considerable proportion of people in England 
        go to &quot;in&quot; clubs and listen to the latest music before it is 
        released, and the top hits list is a creation based on lobbying, without 
        any connection to reality whatsoever. In actuality, England's Top 40 is 
        simply an institution of power that the pop industry employs to tell the 
        public what they should buy. Since entries on the list go up and down 
        at a violent rate, new music and new artists must be generated constantly 
        (<i>translator's note</i>: At the time of this translation, a clear-cut 
        example would be <i>The Spice Girls</i>). In this frenzy, hundreds of 
        artists get their chance to show what they can do, for better or for worse. 
        Originality is much more interesting than technical skill. In this manner, 
        the pop industry sought out acid house music from the small suburban clubs, 
        and the improbable event that this narrow genre made the hits list actually 
        occurred. This phenomenon has turned England into the &quot;engine&quot; 
        behind European popular music.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In Germany, Sven V&#228;th and a myriad 
        of other DJ's produced a mix of techno and ambient clearly influenced 
        by the eighties' acid house: <i>trance</i>, which in England was combined 
        with influences from the Indian vacation paradise Goa and labeled <i>goa-techno</i>. 
        Some half-crazed Dutch guys who called themselves <b>Rotterdam Termination 
        Source</b> made a piece of music using only drums and sound effects: <i>Poing</i>. 
        In this manner they created a genre called hardcore techno, which has 
        developed into a hybrid of techno and death metal, often using a tempo 
        of 300-400 bpm. This hybrid has gotten some former metalheads into techno.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Electronic pop music is never static: there's 
        always something new, and there's constant experimentation in small studios 
        around the world. Crossover techno, in which techno is mixed with other 
        music genres, springs up everywhere. It is often very commercial, with 
        perhaps the exception of the hyper-experimental <b>The Grid</b>, who have 
        for the first time in their career made a commercial success with <i>Swamp 
        Thing</i> - a mix of techno and banjo pieces. <i>Jungle</i> is a genre 
        which is both a predecessor to and a continuation of The Prodigy's breakbeat-techno 
        - a mix of techno, rag and dub music which seems very promising and which 
        is also not particularly commercialized. The most hardcore is <i>gabber</i>, 
        which is a corrupted version of hardcore techno. God knows what's going 
        to be invented next: <i>gospel techno</i>, perhaps?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Other musicians, such as Future Sound of 
        London, Black Dog Productions and the Swedish <b>Lucky People Center</b>, 
        have approached electronic music and make up a genre known as progressive 
        house, i. e. house music which is going somewhere, and is always under 
        development. These people want to escape the concept of genres by breaking 
        all norms. Thanklessly, genre-breaking becomes a genre in itself; there 
        is a similar phenomenon within jazz.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As soon as a genre becomes commercial, as 
        when techno became eurodance through U96, the smaller clubs tend to invent 
        some new variant and sneak back into the underground. Examples of this 
        include Jungle, Goa-techno and Gabber. Jungle is, at the time of this 
        writing, on its way out of the underground, and new styles are most certainly 
        being created as we speak in some studio in Germany, England, Holland 
        or Belgium. You can hold whatever opinion you want on this; in practice, 
        the entire underground club culture is simply a concept factory for the 
        pop industry. They find something new, polish it and water it down a bit, 
        and then release it for a mass audience. If you believe in infinite artistic 
        integrity and creative art, it's probably a horrible thing to witness. 
        On the other hand, maybe we should be thankful that we're not listening 
        to the same chewing-gum pop music of twenty years ago.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Clubs and Raves<br>
        </b>Techno is mostly played in small private clubs, even though it is 
        today <i>possible</i> to sell techno albums to people who are not DJ's. 
        As a cultural manifestation, techno has strong ties to the dance floor, 
        and the two could be said to constitute a unified whole.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dance music has changed the music market. 
        In the old days, you listened to the radio and checked out your friends' 
        preferences, bought the records and listened to them at home. Nowadays, 
        you go to a dance club or even a rave, and become influenced by the music 
        you hear there - the type of music that's made for dancing. Later, you 
        might by an album or two. Eurodance mix albums are especially strong sellers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Techno is not designed for &quot;easy listening&quot; 
        at home, and it can have a stressful effect if it is used as background 
        music. In England, where the public traditionally is very open to new 
        forms of music, heavy and uncompromising techno music has made a commercial 
        breakthrough; likewise in Germany, which with its tradition of electronic 
        music <i>a la</i> Kraftwerk welcomes any new innovations in that realm. 
        Even in Southern Europe, really heavy techno tracks are played on pop 
        radio.<sup><a href="#FTNT1">(1)</a></sup></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Raves are still very underground events 
        in Sweden and Scandinavia, even if its interest base has grown explosively 
        since 1988. Today, there are <i>thousands</i> of happy ravers in Sweden, 
        who are often willing to travel far to attend a good rave. In Germany 
        and Great Britain, raves are already accepted cultural events, which in 
        some cases attract up to150,000 people, such as the well-known <i>Mayday</i> 
        rave in Germany (which is sometimes described as the Woodstock of our 
        time). Special raves are also arranged for different genres. Raves in 
        Scandinavia are usually not announced in the daily press; the information 
        is spread through the grapevine and through flyers that are available 
        given the right contacts.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A type of rave that receives a lot of attention 
        is the so-called <i>bryt-rave</i> (English: <i>break-rave</i>), which 
        entails breaking into a warehouse, setting up a sound stage and starting 
        to dance. It is reminiscent of a sort of house occupation, and if the 
        number of attendees is large, the police stands powerless. This type of 
        rave has been somewhat frequent in Hammarbyhamnen (<i>Hammarby Harbor</i>) 
        in Stockholm. One could make a connection to the Prodigy track <i>break 
        &amp; enter</i>, in which sounds of glass braking and doors being pushed 
        open accompany the music. The sense of revolt and insolence against society 
        is complete.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The rave culture is primarily based on the 
        Trance genre, which can keep a dance floor alive all through the night 
        with its long songs in a perfect dance tempo. A rave is not an event to 
        attend to get drunk or pick up someone. A rave is a place for dancing, 
        listening to music, meeting and looking at other people. Whoever attends 
        a rave with different intentions will invariably be disappointed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Rave culture is claiming expansion - even 
        futuristic dress and other methods of creating a homogeneous group identity 
        have started to develop. The rave sites (mostly warehouses) have also 
        started to receive futuristic interiors to give more of a &quot;cyber-feeling&quot; 
        to the environment. The phenomenon has gained a Swedish face through<b> 
        Mikael J&#228;gerbrand</b>, editor-in-chief of the relatively new magazine 
        <b>NU NRG Update</b> (pronounced &quot;New Energy&quot;), which has a 
        run of about 1000 copies and has a layout that really screams &quot;underground&quot;; 
        the page layout is reminiscent of American tabloid classifieds. It is 
        of course a good move - ravers <i>love</i> being underground. Despite 
        its small circulation, the magazine is not sectarian or single-minded, 
        and it shows a certain sense of distance and social awareness.<sup><a href="#FTNT2">(2)</a></sup></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> There's also a few smaller fanzines, and 
        naturally a few electronic bulletins and magazines.<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        <b>Clubs, Trends, and Drugs<br>
        </b>The (Swedish) debate around dance events such as acid parties and 
        raves is severely inflamed by the narcotics debate. The underground dance 
        culture is under no circumstances endorsing or approving of drug use. 
        Unfortunately, sometimes people attending dance events can be total spacebrains<sup><a href="#FTNT3">(3)</a></sup></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">. The main purpose of dance parties was and 
        remains dancing and music. Originally, acid parties were completely drug-free 
        events.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As early as the late 80's, the discos on 
        Ibiza (a Spanish island resort) hooked on to the acid house trend and 
        created their own version, <i>balearic beat</i>, a mix between house, 
        flamenco (!), and a few other styles mostly associated with the artist 
        <b>Paul Oakenfold</b>. Ibiza is primarily visited by rich people, mostly 
        from England, and it has drugs in abundance.<br>
        The reason for the popular connection between drugs and acid house/rave 
        is thus that those who enjoyed partying all night before the introduction 
        of the acid parties, brought their strange fashionable drugs when they 
        went to visit one. Especially the &quot;designer drug&quot; Ecstasy, a 
        mix between amphetamines and LSD, has figured heavily in the media. Ecstasy 
        is originally a &quot;yuppie-drug&quot;, which has become a sort of exclusive 
        marijuana for the rich. In the beginning it was sold as a diet drug. The 
        greatest culpability for the narcotic stamp on rave and acid culture falls 
        on English upper-class youths. The drugs ruined the reputation of all 
        the intense house-clubs around Manchester, and the stigma remains.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nonetheless, Ecstasy, amphetamines, and 
        cocaine are present at some rave-like events. As expected, it seems to 
        occur more at purely commercial dances, to which the &quot;in&quot; crowd 
        that want to stay abreast of the new culture is drawn. Enthusiasts at 
        small techno clubs are mostly of the opinion that Ecstasy is a nuisance 
        which ruins the reputation of techno culture. Unfortunately, since everything 
        that is prohibited is also &quot;rebellious&quot;, drugs have spread to 
        several acid and techno clubs, including Swedish ones. The clueless middle-class 
        rebel thinks, as usual, that you're a <i>real</i> rebel only when you 
        do drugs. Independent thought is never popular among conformist groups. 
        In short: ravers with brains stay away from drugs, and those who don't 
        know anything naturally think drugs are really cool (no, it's true - people 
        <i>never</i> learn).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Large clubs are frequent in major cities. 
        They are kitschy, well decorated, with mean bouncers and a fairly long 
        line regardless of whether it's full or not (to create demand, of course). 
        They are not about supporting some subculture, even though many DJ's from 
        the underground scene get a chance to make some money in these clubs. 
        Drugs are consumed in the bathrooms.<sup><a href="#FTNT4">(4)</a></sup></font> 
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The terror in homes around the country is 
        complete. The poor parents of these young people remember with horror 
        those few years at the end of the 60's, when they themselves were swept 
        up by the wind from San Francisco, smoked marijuana and hasch, and tried 
        LSD. Not many are willing to admit to that today, but their fear of their 
        kids doing the same thing today is genuine. The main theme then was protesting 
        the Vietnam War and society, and the main theme today is dancing and having 
        fun. Ravers don't need politics as an excuse to meet and enjoy themselves. 
        Drugs are tangential, and not at all as prevalent as media would have 
        it appear. Fear and misunderstanding often inflates the problem to bizarre 
        proportions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">One thing that ravers do enjoy are so-called 
        <i>smart drinks</i> - energy drinks that help rave dancers keep dancing 
        a long, long time. Mostly it is a matter of substances that can be found 
        in any pharmacy or herbal medicine store, but with different labels. There 
        is no reason to suppose that this should be harmful - middle-aged Swedes 
        have consumed the pills for decades without suffering harm. What is worse 
        is the tendency to mix prescription drugs with the drinks, which is something 
        that cyperpunks in particular do sometimes (more on this in the next chapter). 
        Most of the &quot;emergencies&quot; reported about drugs on rave parties 
        is due to journalists attending some event and seeing these sugar pills 
        and sodas on the bar, frequently wrapped in some pastel-colored paper 
        or foil, which naturally appear very ominous. If you interview young people 
        who have been to a rave, they most likely will say yes to having taken 
        Ecstasy, even if they've actually consumed a bunch of St. John's Wort. 
        It happens, sometimes.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some member of the debate has tried to submit 
        the fact that the dancing itself is harmful. The statement that the capacity 
        of ecstatic dance - which is imprinted in our genes since thousands of 
        years - fails by virtue of its own stupidity. Such a statement is thus 
        rather an expression of conservative cultural values or even xenophobia, 
        which seems to be a characteristic of many &quot;opiners&quot;. Obviously, 
        the people that do not attend regular dance clubs and listen to Stairway 
        to Heaven for the 18803<sup>rd</sup> time, while drinking themselves silly, 
        and are not there just to try to get laid, must be <i>suspect</i>&#133; 
        cluelessness, in short.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even in Sweden, frightened cops have broken 
        up rave parties for no reason whatsoever in their total ignorance of how 
        underground culture works. Some police raids against rave dances most 
        closely resemble ethnic discrimination - of the same kind practiced by 
        customs agents and retail security officers who target people of different 
        pigmentation or dress. Some cops are apparently susceptible to excessive 
        stereotypical categorization.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The cause of the cultural phenomenon of 
        rave is that the actual dancing at the larger, commercial clubs has become 
        secondary. The organizers are mostly interested in selling as much beer 
        and liquor as possible, and the patrons are more oriented towards boozing 
        and picking up someone than dancing. The inherent value of the dance has 
        been abandoned.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It has occurred to me that it might actually 
        be a good thing that rave suffers from a bad reputation. It prevents people 
        with purely commercial interests from advertising gigantic rave parties, 
        and thereby commercializing the vibrant underground technoculture. Sometimes 
        it even seems that ravers are somewhat amused by having a &quot;bad reputation&quot;, 
        for identifying with the underground. In Sweden, this negative image has 
        only had the effect of attracting more young people to the parties.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Music and Music Culture</b><br>
        In reference to electronic music, it generally seems as if every new generation 
        of innovative musicians is scorned by the previous one: classical electronic 
        musicians look with distaste on electronic pop music, synth pop fans despise 
        heavy synth and techno musicians, techno musicians dislike hardcore techno 
        musicians etc. etc. It might be redundant to mention that classical and 
        rock musicians scorn all forms of electronic music.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This is probably a necessary state of affairs. 
        It is the distancing from older norms that creates a new subcultural group 
        within an accepted domain, and this is how culture grows and develops. 
        The argument is applicable to literature, film, theater - in short, all 
        types of art.&nbsp;Techno music and techno culture is, especially due 
        to the influence of television, inextricably associated with the art of 
        video and computing. That techno is inseparable from dance has already 
        been illustrated. This development of popular culture has resulted in 
        many artists that are more like some form of product than people. The 
        music is created in a studio, performed by a group of photo models, etc. 
        Popular music becomes more than music - it becomes part of a culture. 
        You don't buy just a record, you buy a lifestyle. Fashion, dance, film 
        - everything is included. It could be summarized and called &quot;art&quot;. 
        Popular art.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Art grows and develops when individuals, 
        with a desire to create something new where not everything has been tried, 
        go against the norms and create something new. Mostly the individuals 
        are young, such as Sex Pistols, Grateful Dead, Bob Dylan or Jack Kerouac 
        (well, they were young when they started). Sometimes it is some eccentric 
        artistic soul like Marcel Proust, James Joyce, or Frank Zappa. When a 
        young artist breaks out of the norms there arises, given the right circumstances, 
        a new subculture, which under even more conducive circumstances creates 
        a new spirit of a generation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The smaller the Earth becomes, and the farther 
        our mass media reach, the more subcultures develop, generations change 
        faster, and society changes faster. This is a characteristic of the post-industrial 
        society which I will later explore further. Let it be stated that the 
        breaking of norms and creation of new ones is very important for these 
        new styles of music. It also has a considerable importance for the more 
        central points of this book.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We will now see how the pulsing rhythm in 
        culture generated an entirely new literary genre, a new view of society, 
        and - soon - a new ideology. <br>
        </font></p>

      <font color="#999999"><a name="FTNT1"></a> 1. In Sweden, as of late 1996 
      no such breakthrough has taken place. Perhaps the Swedish public is simply 
      too conservative. However, things are slowly moving forward. Kalle Dernulf, 
      of P3 (part of Swedish national public radio), is probably the one who has 
      dedicated himself the most to spreading Swedish and foreign techno in the 
      ether.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT2"></a> 2. J&#228;gerbrand and the Swedish Rave Organization 
      (SRO) are at the time of this writing organizing a &quot;raverixdag&quot; 
      (English (loosely translated): <i>Rave Congress</i>) to coordinate Swedish 
      rave organizers. Someone remarked sarcastically that &quot;they seem to 
      have to make <i>everything</i> political&quot;, but in light of the Nacka 
      Police Department's dubious raids against Docklands (a rave site) during 
      the Spring of 1996, the need for an organized resistance group is understandable.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT3"></a> 3. Some have made the observation that it shouldn't 
      be a great experience to attend a rave on a &quot;downer&quot; drug, such 
      as hasch. I have personally observed that it appears fairly abundundantly 
      at raves; why, I do not understand. Possibly it may be due to the hasch 
      (THC) having a mildly psychedelic effect. In this context, I'd like to take 
      the opportunity to mention that I'm personally neither for nor against drugs 
      <i>per se</i>, which you might conclude from the strong formulation above. 
      What I am against is the tendency to blame drug use on culture. On drugs 
      in general I don't have a clear and expressed opinion, rather I reserve 
      the privilege of ignoring that debate, which is sure to piss somebody off.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT4"></a> 4. If someone interprets this to mean that I think 
      that these &quot;beer caf&#233;s</font><font color="#999999">&quot;</font> 
      <font color="#999999"> are the pathetic hangouts of the &quot;in&quot; crowd, 
      that someone has interpreted me correctly.</font></td>
