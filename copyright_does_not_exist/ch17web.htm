      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        an ideological</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> utopia, 
        one can discern a decentralized community with the perfect technology 
        for creating virtual reality, in which really only technology, communication, 
        the legal system, and food production has to be state regulated. (Everything 
        else can be synthesized in artificial reality). What the individual engages 
        in in his or her virtual reality - like electronic dreams - should be 
        protected from all governmental control. Perversions and aggressions can 
        be realized without putting other people in danger. Therefore, it is suggested 
        that people would become more harmonious creatures, with a mind free from 
        the oppressive norms of society, finding their way back to the <i>real</i> 
        values. (Whatever they may be). It's about disconnecting the individual 
        consciousness from the collective consciousness - for better and for worse.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> In such a cyber-utopia, the 
        real reality and nature have lost their meaning, since you can experience 
        an artificial one that's much better.&nbsp;In a cyber-utopia, people are 
        driven by group fellowship to explore the world. Small interest groups 
        can research their areas and communicate over the networks. All boring, 
        dangerous and monotonous work is conducted by robots. <i>&quot;Humankind 
        should concern itself with love, science, and art&quot;</i>, to cite a 
        famous Swedish rock band. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In a cyber-utopia, you can 
        meet people all over the world and still be at home, physically speaking. 
        Humanity is just a keystroke away.&nbsp;This utopia (like all others) 
        naturally has obvious drawbacks, but this is the way it is. (Myself, I 
        think it's horrible). For example, one could debate the wisdom of letting 
        pedophiles, for example, live out their dreams in a virtual reality. Totally 
        new political issues are raised in such a community: should we regulate 
        people's actions, or is it - terrible thought - actually their <i>thoughts</i> 
        that we want to regulate?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The cyberpunks want you to 
        be able to think and enact anything without harming others, and technology 
        might give us this possibility - but do we really want <i>everyone</i> 
        to be able to realize their fantasies, <i>even</i> if it doesn't harm 
        anyone? Several philosophers have pointed out the risk of living in a 
        society without stable norms. Is the repression of thought necessary to 
        protect humankind? Can technology aid us in finding those functions that 
        connect our individual consciousnesses with the collective by giving us 
        the opportunity to &quot;disconnect&quot;? Can today's outsiders find 
        their way into society with the assistance of technology?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">People who <i>like</i> monotonous 
        work, who think that intellectual exercises are boring, or who would rather 
        engage in sports or hunting, wouldn't have a place in a cybernetic society. 
        On the other hand - if you had grown up in such a society - what's suggesting 
        that you would put any value on such trivial matters? A lot of our current 
        society would seem inhuman and despicable to a person originating in the 
        1700s.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> And as for the artificial 
        intelligence that has to exist in order to create this partially artificial 
        world we already live in - does <i>it</i> have any rights? Do we really 
        have the right to use artificial intelligences as slaves, as we currently 
        use social hierarchies to make other people work for us? Machines are 
        actually already part of the collective consciousness I call superindividuals 
        - they're already thinking along with us. The information age focuses 
        on these new ethical issues and forces us to consider them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you're frightened by cyberpunk 
        and the information revolution, I'm afraid I'll have to say that they're 
        not so easy to stop. What you can do is learning more and helping to control 
        the development of society towards a desirable state. If you're passive, 
        you leave decision making up to others. Begin by <i>understanding</i> 
        that which you criticize, and only then can you start influencing things. 
        Reprimands and threats have very little effect on my generation. If someone 
        complains enough to bother us, we just switch the channel. (Zap!). Don't 
        think that we're not interested in your views, however. We listen - if 
        you know what you're talking about. The suggested literature section at 
        the end of this book is a good start if you want to learn more.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One thing that radically distinguished 
        the information revolution from the industrial revolution is that many 
        people have been prepared and have had time to become learned in the ways 
        of technology. The development of society is <i>questioned</i> in broad 
        circles, and isn't left up to politicians and corporations. People in 
        general, and especially young people, question and critique. Hackers, 
        cyberpunks, ravers, and others are the most questioning - they want to 
        be part of creating their own future, and refuse to passively meld into 
        the pattern. They have optimism and a belief in the future, and they rush 
        to meet it. This youth movement is sometimes referred to as the <i>New 
        Edge</i>. These children of the information age don't see only threats, 
        but possibilities.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I'm not a doomsayer, and this 
        is not a dark book. As wise as I am, I've saved the most important point 
        for last.&nbsp;There's been a lot of complaining lately. Many contemporary 
        philosophers have suggested that humankind has locked itself into a pattern 
        of progression, in which consumption has to constantly increase until 
        people just can't consume anymore. This is probably true. We will consume 
        more. Further, they think that this will lead to environmental decay and 
        global segregation, which will eradicate all of humanity. This, however, 
        probably isn't true.&nbsp;It's not true because those who speak in these 
        pessimistic terms have been incapable of noticing a very important contemporary 
        detail: the entrance of the information society. More precisely, the mistake 
        has been to presume that a constantly increased level of consumption necessarily 
        <i>requires</i> an increased consumption of natural resources. There is 
        no such relationship in the information society. (I might add that I'm 
        perhaps a little too optimistic in reference to the connection between 
        information society and environmental concerns; environmental problems 
        won't go away, but the continuing damage will decrease).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the day I'm writing this, 
        Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 95, has been released with much 
        fanfare at the <i>Globe</i> in Stockholm. I have previously expressed 
        my negative attitude toward this company. Still, it makes me happy to 
        see that national media are reporting this massive marketing effort of 
        a product that ten years ago <i>no one</i> could even <i>imagine</i> would 
        be sold through galas at the Globe and on TV commercials. It would have 
        been <i>ridiculous</i>. Windows 95 is software, a pure information product. 
        Granted, you get some disks and a book when you buy the program, but those 
        are not the actual product. It's perfectly possible to buy Windows 95 
        without the books or the disks if you buy a new computer where the program 
        is pre-installed on the hard drive.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus, a product is being sold 
        which, compared to a car, required almost no natural resources to produce, 
        even though it cost thousands of hours of work to develop, and will cost 
        <i>billions</i> of hours to consume. When I sit down with this software 
        at home, wrestle with it, create with it and try to make it do my bidding 
        - during this time, I'm not driving a car. I don't consume anything, save 
        for a little electricity and maybe some coffee. I don't eat potato chips, 
        because I don't want the computer to get greasy. (Translator's note: Habits 
        vary. I drink <i>beer</i>, smoke <i>cigarettes</i>, and eat <i>pizza </i>in 
        front of my computer. The main difference is that I probably have to switch 
        keyboards more often.) I don't buy a lot of useless items from the shopping 
        channels on TV that I later just throw away. I basically consume nothing 
        but information. Not even a <i>book</i> is more environmentally friendly. 
        The same phenomenon occurs in most of the rest of the information society 
        - TV: an electronically transmitted product with low demands on natural 
        resources, Multimedia: also primarily an information product, Telephony: 
        an electrical signal from one place to another. Using virtual reality, 
        we can even consume everything we usually do, offroad a four-wheel Jeep, 
        and pilot a spaceship, with no notable wear on nature. There is hope. 
        There is a hell of a lot of hope, even though it's combined with new dangers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">You can note that many of 
        today's products satisfy artificial needs. You could ask whether we ever 
        needed an operating system like Windows 95. Probably not. In a few years, 
        however, we do. This is really not that important - more needs than we 
        think are ultimately artificial. It's sort of like a premise for a market 
        economy. Your mind reels at the thought of security companies that hire 
        a team of hackers to build security systems for their customers, and then, 
        at night, make sure that the same hackers <i>&quot;maintain market image&quot;</i>. 
        Or virus hackers that work half the time on creating virus killing software, 
        and the other half on creating new viruses to create demand for the antivirus 
        tools. <i>Wouldn't you?</i> Of course you would. So what? The gears are 
        spinning, GNP goes up, everyone's happy. In the same way, we've created 
        a dependency on criminal activity, administrative tasks, etc. to no end 
        in this society. There are many such processes, whose only purpose is 
        self-perpetuation and self-justification. Does it matter? No, probably 
        not. It depends on whether or not you think humanity has a &quot;purpose&quot;; 
        whether there is something we should strive towards. But that's philosophy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have moved from material 
        bartering, with merchandise for merchandise, to an economy in which we 
        trade money for goods and goods for money. Now, we're starting an infonomy, 
        trading information for information without intermediary material transactions. 
        The danger that still lurks behind the scenes of our system is a desire 
        for power, in individuals at all levels: corporations, governments, and 
        organizations. They're after power over <i>you</i>. Make sure you don't 
        give up any of your freedom without first knowing what you get in exchange.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I've reached the slightly 
        shocking conclusion that the mechanisms I previously identified as <i>superindividuals</i>, 
        i. e. superior intelligent entities, have no need to produce material 
        products or artifacts in order to control other intelligent entities. 
        Instead, they simply employ exchanges of symbolic information, chunks 
        of info transmitted through cables. Every such superindividual is characterized 
        by the creation of internal chinks of information, secret documents, transmitted 
        inside the individual outside the reach of the public or other superindividuals. 
        That's why corporations, governments, and other organizations are paranoid 
        about someone else reading their secrets, whether important or not. With 
        information technology, the possibility of creating such structures is 
        amplified by a factor of hundreds, and the exchange of information, the 
        thoughts of the superindividual, its intelligence, is expanding at the 
        speed of light. I've also discovered that the information-processing machines 
        are <i>part</i> of these superindividuals, not some accessory of people 
        to assist in their work. Somewhere around this point is where you have 
        to start thinking for yourself.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If <i>you</i> have read <i>this</i> 
        book on a computer, without printing it out on paper, you've consumed 
        something. Or have you? Do I have to charge for this book before it can 
        be called consumption? I'll leave that as an open question.&nbsp;I've 
        certainly not made a dime from you reading this book, but maybe I've accomplished 
        something that can't be measured in terms of money - maybe I've taught 
        you to question the mechanisms of power. (Hmm&#133; if this book ever 
        goes into print, I'll have to modify the above paragraph).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Let me finish with a timeless 
        quote, from a man who belonged at the frontline of his generation:</font></p>

        of the future of the cyberpunk author, Green, is something not to miss. 
        There are many quotes from the Danish network hacker, Netrunner, and the 
        Kraftwerk member Ralf H&#252;tter, which elevate the book.</font></p>
