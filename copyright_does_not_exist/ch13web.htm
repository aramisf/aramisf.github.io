      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Selling and owning </b>information 
        is a profession today. Journalists, PR professionals, consultants, and 
        lobbyists base a large portion of their professional pride on the <i>ownership</i> 
        of information. Naturally, they don't want to share their information 
        unless they get something in exchange, and the things we give them in 
        exchange are decent salaries and social status. Their professions are 
        at risk of being fundamentally changed by information technology, and 
        many of them are aware of this. How?</font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At MIT, the first hackers 
        left their programs (in the form of long strips of paper with holes in 
        them) lying in a box next to the computer. They did this partly so that 
        whoever wanted to could examine them, but also so that whoever felt like 
        it would be able to improve and expand the programs. This open-hearted 
        attitude is an example of typical &quot;hacker mentality&quot;, and has 
        since then characterized almost all research and program development that 
        has taken place over the Internet. This falls under <i>Rule 1</i> in the 
        chapter about cyberpunk: the <i>hands-on imperative</i>. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There are lots of programs 
        that have been developed according to a principle called <i>Stone Soup</i>. 
        This is one of the oldest - if not <i>the</i> oldest - methods in software 
        development. The first hackers at MIT, in the 60'd, worked according to 
        this principle. Today it works like this: a programmer manufactures the 
        core of the project, a working program that provides the <i>foundation</i> 
        for the end product (the stone in the soup). The programmer then puts 
        the program on the Internet and tells all the amateur programmers out 
        there:&nbsp;<i>&quot;Here's the program - if you find any faults and know 
        how to fix them, then please do so. Then send the changes back to me.&quot;</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The original programmer then 
        assumes the role of editor, accepting suggestions and constantly adding 
        to and modifying the program. The end product is then distributed for 
        free. The PC programs <i>Fractint</i> and <i>Pretty Good Privacy</i> (PGP) 
        are just two of the great mass of programs that have been created in this 
        manner. Even if an amateur may not be able to accomplish a lot by him- 
        or herself, he or she is still often an expert at <i>something</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of the first stone soup 
        programs that was really successful was <b>Tiny BASIC</b>, a competitor 
        of Bill Gates' Altair BASIC, which managed to stand out by being much 
        better than Gates' BASIC, and <i>free.</i> (Guess if that was a thorn 
        in the side to some people). Among modern stone soup products there are 
        entire operating systems such as <b>Linux</b> (a project started by <b>Linus 
        Torvalds</b> at Helsinki University, referred to by many as the most successful 
        hacking project of all time), <b>X-Windows</b>, and the <b>EMACS</b> text 
        editor, used in making countless textbooks and college essays. All of 
        these programs are free.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The communications protocol 
        stack called <b>TCP/IP</b> (Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), 
        which is about to conquer the entire market for network communications, 
        is also stone soup. (It is used to make computers &quot;understand&quot; 
        each other when &quot;talking&quot; over a network - TCP/IP is to a computer 
        as a telephone receiver and a dial is to a person). This protocol stack 
        is judged by those who develop the Internet, and is constantly revised 
        and improved as the &quot;editors&quot; send out <i>RFC</i>s (Request 
        for Comments).&nbsp;TCP/IP is completely free, and no one has made money 
        from its invention. It has (without any marketing whatsoever) become so 
        huge simply because no one is fighting over copyrights or trying to keep 
        &quot;commercial secrets&quot; to themselves. On the other hand, it's 
        not hard to make lots of money from the <i>knowledge</i> of how TCP/IP 
        works. The knowledge about the product is therefore of greater value to 
        the market than the product itself. This is why some of the people who 
        know TCP/IP are very secretive about their knowledge, in order to maintain 
        a demand for consulting services.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The companies that are marketing 
        their own communications protocols are naturally displeased about this. 
        That's why they gladly disseminate lies which claim that TCP/IP is of 
        poor quality - even that it's bad and worthless. The most common argument 
        is <i>&quot;the more cooks, the worse the soup&quot;</i> - which means 
        that a lot useless junk supposedly makes it into the programs. This is 
        patently false. The discussion groups evaluate every proposed change before 
        it is incorporated. It's a shame that such rumors are sometimes published 
        in major newspapers and magazines (none mentioned, none forgotten). I 
        prefer to listen to experts like <b>Peter Schaeffer</b> who know what 
        they're talking about.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the front of the defenders 
        of this fundamental technological principle there are people like <b>Richard 
        Stallman</b>, a former MIT hacker who referred to himself for a while 
        as the last real hacker. He established the foundation for <b>GNU</b> 
        as well as <b>EMACS</b>, and his point of view is that software shouldn't 
        be subject to ownership. He is also an influential force behind the <i>Free 
        Software Foundation</i>, which is an organization that primarily concerns 
        itself with the promotion of free software. He has had many software companies 
        up in arms over his method of copying ideas without copying program code, 
        which is known as <i>reverse engineering</i> or simply <i>deconstruction</i>. 
        It involves analyzing a program on an object (machine-code) level, noting 
        its functions, and then creating a program that performs the same tasks. 
        Stallman's productivity in this respect is so legendary that he is referred 
        to as perhaps the greatest and most motivated hacker ever, and fully capable 
        of doing the job of an entire development team on his own. He has also 
        had an influential role in the organization <i>League for Programming 
        Freedom</i>, which has as its mission the liberation of software from 
        patents.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stone soup software also has 
        the advantage of being easily modified or analyzed in order to find out 
        <i>exactly</i> how it works, since all documentation is accessible to 
        whoever wants it. This is in contrast to software that's been manufactured 
        by corporations, which lock source code and documentation in a vault and 
        charge exorbitant prices to share their knowledge when a problem occurs. 
        The intention is that the user should think that the program is so incredibly 
        fantastic that only the in-house programmers (which are presented as some 
        kind of wizards) are able to understand and improve the program. Talk 
        about a monopoly on information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Imagine the stone soup principle 
        being applied to a piece of text, like the one you're reading now. If 
        I had access to an Internet server, I could put this document in <i>hypertext</i> 
        form (which is a kind of text invented by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> subsequent 
        to an idea put forth by <b>Ted Nelson</b>, in which consistent subjects 
        or general keywords are electronically linked in order to allow the reader 
        to quickly jump to different points in the text) and put something like 
        this at the end:<br>
        </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;All of you who are reading this 
          - send in revisions and addenda to me, and I'll put them in the text.&quot;</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It's 
        all free. Anyone could get the document off the Internet. I don't profit 
        from it except for gaining knowledge, and no one else does either. If 
        my document became popular and reached a wide audience, a few experts 
        would (with some luck) contact me with corrections and additions. Not 
        much, but just enough to cover the subject on which that person is an 
        expert. Then, I could assume the role of editor and collate all of this 
        information, put new links in the hypertext and facilitate searching and 
        notices of updates to the text. I would feel that I was doing something 
        useful, but I wouldn't be able to earn a living doing it. After a few 
        years, my document would become an entire database covering almost every 
        aspect of computer culture, more comprehensive, editable, and thorough 
        than any national encyclopaedia, and furthermore it would be written at 
        the grassroots level by people who love what they do.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;<i>So 
        why don't I?</i></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Answer:</b> 
        first of all, I don't have the time or energy.<sup><a href="#FTNT1">(1)</a></sup> 
        Second, it is not a matter of solving a technical problem like those in 
        a computer program; this text is multi-faceted and highly subjective. 
        It bears the mark of my own values and judgments, and I want it to remain 
        as such in the future. Every word is written by <i>myself</i> and no one 
        else. Call it pride. Further, it has a beginning and an end, and it is 
        possible to critique it as something coherent and static, not as something 
        that is constantly morphing. It is possible to form a <i>clear</i> view 
        of the text that lasts a few days, and this is the advantage of the statically 
        fixed text versus the ever-changing one.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
        this were a practical problem of a technical character within any of the 
        natural sciences or medicine, the situation would be radically different. 
        Such hypertext documents are created around the world as we speak. They 
        grow together, forming a world of information, accessible to anyone, anywhere, 
        who has access to the Internet. It's known as the World Wide Web (WWW). 
        By extension, the human <i>hypertextual heritage</i> will grow into a 
        mass of information of such mammoth proportion that it will be impossible 
        to get one's mind around it. It will be like a library of memories for 
        all of humankind.&nbsp;Hypertext is also changing more and more into <i>program 
        code</i>, which erodes the distinction between regular, literary text 
        and computer programs. The professions of author and programmer blend 
        together. This is what multimedia <i>is.</i> The tools used to create 
        multimedia products are not called computer languages, they're called 
        <i>authoring programs</i>.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Some 
        authors of fiction have adopted the idea of publishing their creations 
        for a wide audience, on the Internet. Since fictional writers generally 
        want their works to be read and only incidentally to make money, this 
        is a natural step. The first well-established author to put some of his 
        work on the Internet was <b>Stephen King</b>, on September 19, 1993. Many 
        other authors thought this was a great idea, and published some of their 
        older books on the Web. In Sweden, <b>Lars Fimmerstad</b> was the pioneer 
        in this aspect, with his novel <i>V&#228;lkommen Hem</i> (&quot;Welcome 
        Home&quot;), and shortly thereafter <b>Ola Larsmo</b> followed in his 
        footsteps with his short story, <i>Stumheten</i> (&quot;The Speechlessness&quot;). 
        The more established an author is, the more conservatively he or she approaches 
        electronic publication. To a certain extent they live off their book sales, 
        and feel threatened by a form of publication through which they cannot 
        yet get paid.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
        progress within media is in step with the trends in organizations, which 
        are being transformed into networks - loosely connected associations without 
        staff or representatives, established for the purpose of answering one 
        single question or solving one specific and well-defined problem (making 
        stone soup), and that have so far stayed connected through mail correspondence 
        and phone calls (exchanges of information). Do not confuse a &quot;network&quot; 
        with a &quot;computer network&quot;, even if many &quot;networks&quot; 
        employ &quot;computer networks&quot;. Your local bridge club is a &quot;network&quot;, 
        and the Internet is a &quot;computer network&quot;. A common denominator 
        of all networks is that they distribute information of some kind. (Confusing?) 
        Mnemonic device: bridge club = a network of people, the Internet = a network 
        of computers.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So 
        what's the point of all this?</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Well, 
        it is that network documents will quickly become so numerous that it will 
        be impossible to get an overview of them. Therefore, it is (as always) 
        necessary to go through a long and hard learning process, <i>or </i>hire 
        a consultant, to access a specific piece of knowledge. A typical consultant 
        is a watch group that cover some specific area of interest, which we usually 
        refer to as the technical press, only in this context it's electronic. 
        The need for specialized journalism therefore exists in the information 
        society as well. At the time of this writing, such journals cannot get 
        paid for their information services, but a system is under development. 
        That means that you will be able to <i>buy</i> information about anything 
        using your own computer. Naturally, you don't pay with cash, but with 
        numbers.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">These 
        technical journalists will basically become the first people to earn their 
        living solely by processing information; they'll be the first ones to 
        enter into the total information economy. The other papers will follow, 
        one by one. Some newspapers, such as <b>Aftonbladet/Kultur</b> (a major 
        Swedish evening paper) have anticipated this, and are preparing themselves 
        for the entry into the information economy by experimenting with electronic 
        editions. Other papers remain content with simply publishing electronic 
        complements to their printed material. (In the experimental stage, all 
        of this is free! Grab the chance now that you have it, because it won't 
        come back). In addition to this, and as a natural consequence of it, we'll 
        get a huge number of electronic fanzines<sup><a href="#FTNT2">(2)</a></sup>, 
        due to the amazing <i>simplicity and cheapness</i> of making an electronic 
        publication. (The hacker culture has spawned hundreds or maybe even thousands 
        of such magazines.) No printing costs, no contracts, no advertisers, just 
        information and motivation. Culture without biznizz.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Cynically 
        speaking, journalists are experts at information trading. It's probably 
        the only profession that even before the time of computers made a living 
        solely by producing and processing information. <i>Journalists</i> do 
        <i>not</i> think that information, and therefore knowledge, should be 
        free and universally accessible. On the contrary, each journalist (at 
        least each specialized journalist) jealously guard &quot;their&quot; information 
        sources, not revealing them without very good reason. The journalist is 
        just as conservative and stingy as the elitist and sectarian hacker groups. 
        <i>For the public good</i> is one thing - but even journalists have to 
        eat. It's about protecting one's intellectual property. The truth is that 
        the fourth state, just like the government and the corporate world, also 
        consists of personal contact networks and hierarchies in which string-pulling 
        ability is very important. Even journalists are totally ignorant of hacker 
        ethics, which to a high degree influences their reporting when it comes 
        to hackers.<br>
        The guidelines surrounding electronic publishing indicate the emergence 
        of two new types of media. One will be stored on CD-ROM disks and will 
        contain huge stores of knowledge, such as a database or a searchable encyclopaedia. 
        <b>Interface </b>magazine was first in Sweden to try this. The other type 
        is <i>Online Services</i>, which provide news and information updated 
        daily, hourly, or even more frequently. The <br>
        first Swedish online service was probably <b>Text-TV</b>. The first Swedish 
        online magazine on the Internet was <b>Datateknik</b>.<sup><a href="#FTNT3">(3)</a></sup> 
        At the moment, it is not possible to charge for online services, but that 
        capacity is on its way.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        the long term, CD-ROMs will run into problems. It will soon be very easy 
        to copy the disks, so why should I buy the paper, the encyclopaedia, the 
        dictionary, or whatever, when I can copy it off my<br>
        neighbor? Once you try to protect the information from being copied, you 
        can bet your ass that some hackers will come around and crack the protection 
        and copy it anyway. Online services don't really suffer from this problem.<sup><a href="#FTNT4">(4)</a></sup> 
        Some prophecy the total disappearance of disks in favor of online services, 
        but this is unlikely to happen soon. The need to own the physical form 
        of something, like a compact disk or a print magazine is still strong 
        in our generation.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Others 
        say that mass media will disappear. That depends on how you look at it. 
        Mass media <i>as it is today</i> will certainly go away, but we will also 
        equally certainly get a new definition of mass media. Print publications 
        will most likely remain until we find a way to make electronic information 
        as portable, but that day will come.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        magazine called <i>The Whole Earth Review</i> has aroused public interest 
        in electronic media in the USA. The popular magazine <i>Wired</i>, which 
        I mentioned earlier, is one of the publications that have received a boost 
        from the progress at the electronic frontier. This paper has become extremely 
        popular, not least due to its youthful layout. It has paved the way for 
        several similar magazines across the world, such as Sweden's <b>Z <a href=mailto:Mag@zine >Mag@zine</a></b> 
        and <b>Hall&#229;</b>, which have apparently gotten their whole business 
        idea from magazines like Wired. They write about the Internet, BBSs, everything 
        falling into the category of media and information technology, and fashion 
        and trends. Both publications have (intentionally) refused to acknowledge 
        the existence of the other. Both are currently out of print, but Hall&#229; 
        is restarting soon.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Other 
        American magazines that seem to be great sources of inspiration for this 
        type of media are <b>RayGun</b> and <b>Gray Areas</b>. <b>MONDO 2000</b> 
        is a tad too provocative for the more distinguished circles, as it has 
        a rather conspicuous air of hippie and yippie philosophy.&nbsp;Some people 
        are irritated by these magazines, since they write mostly about each other 
        (media writing about other media, journalists about other journalists, 
        etc.) Seeking a cause for this, one would most likely conclude that media 
        products are changing due to the entrance of information technology. Text 
        and images are becoming easier to edit and distribute, and the purpose 
        of journalists is under re-evaluation, etc. It's also not surprising that 
        journalism is of interest to journalists. With the role of media as the 
        &quot;fourth state&quot;, critiquing itself is probably necessary function. 
        To spice it up, the subjects are often things that are exciting in real 
        life. Preferably hacking, of course. They're the ultra-hyped spearhead 
        of the &quot;information revolution&quot;.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        <i>hackers</i> don't think these magazines are anything special (as the 
        publications seem to think themselves sometimes), but rather refer to 
        them bluntly as <i>hacker-wannabes</i> - trying to write as if they're 
        something they're not. Sweden, for example, is full of Schyffert-wannabes, 
        Guillou-wannabes, and Bildt-wannabes. (As for myself, I'm a Visionary-wannabe 
        ;). The frequent use of trite terms like <i>cyber, powerful, IT</i>, and 
        <i>(insert latest catch-phrase here)</i> is a common denominator for hacker-wannabes, 
        plus that they use Macintosh computers. (Translator's note: <i>HEY! What 
        the hell do you think I started translating this text on?</i>).</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        tendency of aggressive competition among hackers is similar to the brutal 
        reality of everyday journalism, and this is probably the reason that these 
        magazines inherit hacker culture and ideals. Few of these journalists 
        seem to understand the friendly, non-American part of hacker culture, 
        which is not as interesting since it's not as illegal, contains much less 
        confrontation, and built more on friendship than competition. This is 
        of course not so strange, since journalists love conflict and in many 
        cases spur it on. (Conflicts inspire <i>great</i> headlines, and attract 
        readers.)</font></font></p>

        </font></b></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Internet 
        is often referred to as &quot;anarchistic&quot;. This is a gross exaggeration. 
        The Internet is fundamentally <i>technocratic</i> and <i>decentralized. 
        </i>As it was first built, by the university hackers, they wove some of 
        their open-minded attitudes into the web of the Internet. Remember Rule 
        #3 of hacker ethics: <i>Distrust authority - promote decentralization.</i>&nbsp;That 
        is: <i>if I help you, you help me</i>, and nowhere in the core structure 
        of the Internet was there a function for charging each other for the use 
        of communication channels. There were no locked doors, since it was held 
        that everyone should be able to access anything and share their information. 
        (Rule #2: <i>All information should be free</i>.) Just jack in and go. 
        The only things to pay for were the constant phone line connections on 
        which the information flowed, and then you could communicate as much as 
        you wanted. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The entire network has been 
        built using the stone soup principle. Every problem that occurs is posted 
        on discussion groups, after which anyone who wants to may suggest a solution. 
        The users are very eager to help, and usually there are a number of proposed 
        solutions. The proposals are evaluated in the discussion group, and the 
        one that's considered to be the best wins. The result is documented and 
        then distributed as a <i>de facto</i> standard.&nbsp;This technocratic 
        method of problem-solving is radically different from the market model. 
        In a market economy, companies <i>compete</i> for the best solution. Each 
        company has an R&amp;D division that develop a solution, which is then 
        marketed. After that, consumers judge the products by buying the one that 
        suits them the most. The &quot;bad&quot; solutions are thrown out as the 
        companies that fail to get enough market share discontinue their productmaking 
        and buy patents from the successful companies, or, at worst, go bankrupt. 
        In this manner it is suggested that the best product always survives.<sup><a href="#FTNT5">(5)</a></sup> 
        (Translator's note: it's also highly circular, as the &quot;market&quot; 
        judges the &quot;marketing and marketability&quot; of a &quot;marketed&quot; 
        product).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The problem is that the winning 
        solutions in a market economy aren't always <i>technically superior</i>. 
        They might as well be the <i>best marketed</i> or <i>cheapest</i> products. 
        For example, reflect on how the VHS video system beat the technically 
        superior Betamax system. (According to legend, this was ultimately due 
        to the fact that the VHS format was marketed by the adult video industry&#133;. 
        hmmm.)<sup><a href="#FTNT6">(6)</a></sup> (<i>Translator's note:</i> How 
        about Windows...). This would never happen in a technocracy like the Internet. 
        A technocracy doesn't allow marketing or arbitrariness to send a good 
        idea into the wastebasket of history. It's pretty typical for the universities 
        to build a technocratic network, since their main goal is always technological 
        progress.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In a market economy, it is 
        the <i>carrot</i> of personal gain and wealth that drive the businesspeople 
        to develop better and better products. In a technocracy, it's personal 
        commitment, fellowship, and the desire to advance knowledge that drives 
        the developers. With the Internet, this attitude towards research and 
        product development has spread across the world, and sometimes it generates 
        solutions that completely beat out those of the market economy. It's not 
        a planned economy, since there's no single authority that finances and 
        evaluates the products. It's a technocracy, based upon individuals in 
        voluntary cooperation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In addition to the university 
        researchers, who thanks to secure personal finances are able to dedicate 
        themselves to solving Internet problems at work, many people employed 
        at regular market-driven companies have started developing solutions to 
        different technical problems on their own private time. The desire to 
        show one's competence in a technical field, and to be accepted as a skilled 
        developer among others on the Net, has been enough to motivate these people 
        to develop technical solutions. Call it the joy of working or professional 
        pride. (Yes, these still exist even in our time).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Whether technocracy is a threat 
        or a complement to a market economy is hard to predict. Perhaps we're 
        entering a form of <i>knowledge economy</i>. It is, however, clear that 
        with internationalization and the ability to work in small interest groups 
        across great distances, we have found a so-called &quot;nonprofit&quot; 
        force that enables us to perform practical work and have fun at the same 
        time. Group fellowship is the same as that among the hackers, who have 
        long been exchanging experience through letters, BBSs, copy parties, and 
        the Internet. The only difference is that one form is more &quot;respectable&quot; 
        than the other.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As I suggested earlier, it's 
        possible to detect an anarchistic ideological heritage within technocracy. 
        <b>Peter Krapotkin</b> thought that society should be run through the 
        cooperative efforts of independent groups. As opposed to <b>Charles Darwin</b>, 
        who thought that races (and by extension, society) evolved through competition, 
        Kropotkin emphasized the important role of <i>cooperation</i> in the building 
        of a society. The Internet technocracy is in some ways proof that free 
        groups independently set up cooperative relationships without governmental 
        influence. The <i>virtual society</i> is anarchistic, in this way. At 
        the same time, there <i>is </i>an aspect of Darwinism, in that only the 
        best solutions survive. The difference is that this happens as a result 
        of mutual agreement and doesn't affect any people or companies in a negative 
        manner.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#0000a0"><b><font color="#000000">A 
        Few Examples<br>
        </font></b></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I once (in 
        my foolish youth) wrote an opinion piece and sent it to Datateknik magazine 
        (a Swedish computer publication). In this piece, I lamented the poor availability 
        of digitized (machine-readable, stored in a computer or on disks) literature, 
        and the fact that our cultural heritage wasn't properly electronically 
        stored. I suggested that publishers should be forced to make non-copyrighted 
        material available to the public, every time they re-printed older literary 
        works. I received a well-motivated and angry reply by <b>Lars Aronsson</b>, 
        project leader for <i>Projekt Runeberg</i>, which electronically publishes 
        Swedish literature. In my na&#239;ve excitement, I'd simply been thinking 
        practically, and overlooked the market aspects of the whole thing. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Digitized text is of course 
        a competitive advantage during re-printing, and my proposal could hurt 
        the competitive power of a certain company. Another company could (if 
        my system was applied) steal the text directly from the publisher and 
        publish the same book as a new edition, which would lead to a loss for 
        the first company which had paid to have someone enter the text in a word 
        processor.<br>
        The fact remains that it is a waste of human resources to let several 
        people carry out the monotonous task of re-entering the same text over 
        and over, instead of storing it in a central location and making it accessible 
        to everyone - companies as well as individuals. This is one of the disadvantages 
        of the market economy, which technocracy is trying to address: the market 
        economy sometimes demands wasting natural resources and duplicating work 
        efforts. You could make an analogy with the development of the mobile 
        phone networks, where several small, incompatible networks are being built 
        instead of one large, stable, and widely adaptable network. Call it greed 
        or competition - but it's <i>not</i> cost-effective. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Naturally, this wastefulness 
        is actually <i>a good thing</i> according to our classical yardstick of 
        the public good. GNP increases, and people get something to do (work). 
        One should, however, ask if people fare well from this. We're living in 
        a time in which the quality of life is measured by socioeconomic number-juggling. 
        Is it a good idea to create problems to make jobs for problem-solvers? 
        To provoke crime in order to employ crime attorneys and investigators? 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The technocrats on the Internet, 
        spearheaded by League for Programming Freedom, hold the view that good 
        knowledge should not be subject to patent. The companies, however, do. 
        There's already been open conflict between idealists and profit-hungry 
        corporate people. I've already touched upon the negative rumors spread 
        about &quot;stone soup software&quot;. Another example is the fighting 
        over a compression method known as LZW, which is simply a modification 
        of a public-domain method called LZ2, which originated at Jerusalem University. 
        Basically, companies can possess so much chutzpah that they take out patents 
        on methods, developed by idealists, which were originally intended to 
        be public domain. Companies also have the time and money to sue&#133;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another direct example of 
        the difference between market-driven and idealistic thinking is the way 
        various commercial firms are fighting over email services through the 
        Internet. Swedish Telia has had a taste of technocracy. The background 
        is as follows: Telia has no problem getting access to the Internet. The 
        problem is that Telia wants to decide how certain Internet addresses should 
        appear. It's always a good thing to be able to butter up your customers 
        with a custom, easily memorized number (Like Swedish Railways' 020-75 
        75 75) <i>Sadly</i>, Telia is not in charge of these things on the Internet. 
        The principle is that all commercial domains on the Internet should have 
        the -COM suffix, as in COMmercial. Instead, Telia wants to give companies 
        the 400NET prefix, which happens to be the name of their commercial electronic 
        mail system.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Bernt Allonen</b> at Telia 
        says this in <a href=mailto:Z-mag@zine >Z-mag@zine</a>, 1/95: <i>&quot;It's 
        time for the Internet to leave the sandbox</i>&#133; <i>the Internet is 
        in need of strict rules and operators that guarantee performance.&quot;</i> 
        With this he's probably tried to say that the Internet should be market-driven, 
        like a company - as opposed to the reality of its current operational 
        mode, namely non-profit/academic - with all its implications, like rigid 
        bureaucracy, market planning, and little hierarchies in which the golden 
        rule is: kick downwards, kiss upwards.<sup><a href="#FTNT7">(7)</a></sup> 
        Mostly, he would like to see Telia assuming total control of Internet 
        distribution in Sweden, so that things could become <i>orderly</i>. This 
        is not the case, and hopefully never will be. Who really cares what Bernt 
        Allonen thinks? He only represents the expansionist interests of a single 
        large corporation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The people who hold the most 
        power over the Internet in Sweden are <b>Bj&#246;rn Eriksen</b> and <b>Peter 
        L&#246;thberg</b>. Both are representatives of the open, technocratic 
        attitude, and Bj&#246;rn decides which <i>domains</i> (Internet names 
        or addresses) can be created on the Swedish part of the Internet. To the 
        great chagrin of Telia, their market plans have no effect whatsoever on 
        these academicians. The Internet <i>cannot be bought!</i> May Heaven have 
        mercy. The academicians are not at all concerned about &quot;orderliness&quot; 
        on the Internet. In their eyes, the Internet primarily exists to be <i>useful,</i> 
        not <i>marketable</i>. Is it a good idea to tell Telia that all these 
        idealists and academicians have actually succeeded in building the world's 
        <i>largest</i> computer network <i>completely without competition, market 
        analysis, and commercial ad campaigns?</i> Now that Telia's X.400-network 
        hasn't been as successful as the Internet, what is Telia to do? Well, 
        of course they want the rights to the Internet. Normally, a giant corporation 
        like Telia can indiscriminately purchase and take over their competitors.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thinking people, however, 
        are much harder to purchase. Telia represents the philosophy of the old 
        market theory, which states that people that cannot be bought for money 
        can be bought for <i>more</i> money. Internet-users, with the technical 
        universities at the base, have a completely different way of thinking. 
        If there had been anything else than market tactics behind Telia's demands, 
        they might have listened. Fortunately, they prefer to continue thinking. 
        Thanks to this view, no one has a monopoly on the Internet in Sweden. 
        Hundreds of companies are currently fighting to provide Internet access. 
        The competition has pushed prices down to an incredibly low level. An 
        Internet connection is today very affordable for a normal person, and 
        everyone who has decent knowledge of the process can buy some computers 
        and modems and start their own Internet node. Variety as opposed to monopoly. 
        From this point of view, the Internet promotes small operators and resists 
        the efforts of giant corporations. Again, refer to Rule #3 of hacker ethics: 
        decentralization.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Rule #3 is also one of the 
        reasons that cyberpunks and others work against <b>Microsoft</b>, and 
        especially its operating system, <i>Windows</i>. When hundreds of hackers 
        were arrested during <i>Operation Sundevil</i>, it was because law enforcement 
        thought that hackers were behind the collapse in the American telephone 
        system on January 15, 1990. Now, it turned out that hackers had nothing 
        to do with it. Instead, the collapse was due to an error in the <i>computer 
        program</i> that controlled the switches. The problem was exacerbated 
        by the fact that the program was used everywhere, and the switches &quot;brought 
        each other down&quot;. The only switches that worked fine were those that 
        used another, older program. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Microsoft's Windows is also 
        a program, and more specifically, an operating system, which means that 
        it's a program that is used to enable the user to run other programs. 
        Today, it is installed on virtually every PC computer that is sold in 
        Sweden. Most programs today require Windows in order to function. Therefore, 
        Windows is used by innumerable private companies and governmental organizations, 
        including Swedish Railways and the Swedish <i>national defense</i>. Recently, 
        a new version of Windows, called <i>Windows 95</i>, was released. <sup><a href="#FTNT8">(8)</a></sup> 
        This will, among other things, be used to provide easy connections between 
        several computers, over the Internet and other networks.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Now, what if there was an 
        error similar to that in the American telephone system's switch software 
        - but inside <i>Windows 95?</i> In that case, every computer that used 
        Windows 95 would crash. There is no way to prove empirically that a computer 
        program is free of such errors. It's thus entirely possible -and it's 
        happened before. Such risks exist with other, nearly monopolizing products, 
        such as <i>Netscape</i>. A few moronic computer folks might think that 
        it's impossible, but so was Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, so I don't 
        buy that. And by the way, I also know what I'm talking about. (Pardon 
        the conceited and provocative comment).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If something like that happened, 
        large parts of Swedish society would be knocked out. We have a parallel 
        case with the virus that in the fall of 1988 crippled the Internet by 
        putting 6,000 computers out of commission. It was an error in the Berkely-UNIX 
        (BSD) operating system that allowed this virus to be created. Some computers 
        were unaffected by the virus - by virtue of using another &quot;dialect&quot;, 
        i.e. another version of UNIX, like NeXT or AIX (there's about 11 different 
        versions of UNIX). UNIX basically works in the same way as Windows<sup><a href="#FTNT9">(9)</a></sup>, 
        but there's <i>only one &quot;dialect&quot; of Windows!</i> If all computers 
        had used the <i>same</i> UNIX in the fall of 1988, well, all of the Internet 
        would have been brought down! I'm stating that this could happen even 
        to Windows 95, or one of its successors. If this happened, all Windows 
        95 systems could crash, if they were networked. It would be a catastrophe 
        of unpredictable consequences to society.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is where it's important 
        to emulate nature. <i>Variety</i>, in which many <i>different</i> programs 
        work side by side, is preferable. Hackers have always proposed variety 
        and decentralization. In the long term, software monopolies are harmful, 
        and lead to problems in computer systems that resemble those that occur 
        with the <i>inbreeding </i>of living creatures. The only ones able to 
        compete with Microsoft today is <b>IBM</b>, with its OS/2 operating system, 
        and <b>Apple</b>, with MacOS. Personally, I look forward to more competition. 
        Variety, decentralization, and small companies instead of giants and institutionalism 
        is the only thing that's sustainable in the long term. Microsoft cannot 
        be allowed to dominate the operating system market. Chaos is fun. And 
        healthy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The arrests of hackers after 
        the Jan. 1, 1990 incident was a distraction to obscure the inbreeding 
        within the telephone system and the incompetence of large companies by 
        blaming hackers for what was really a structural problem. What are they 
        to be blamed for next?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There are oodles of examples 
        of how the market's been beaten by home-made solutions. Some computer 
        nerds therefore want to stop this spreading disease by trying to stop 
        the publicly financed distribution channels. One such channel is <a href=ftp://ftp.sunet.se >ftp.sunet.se</a>, 
        an Uppsala computer system which stores thousands of quality, free-of-charge 
        programs. This computer is publicly funded and anyone can connect through 
        the Internet and retrieve any of these programs. This is actually a good 
        thing, since all of Sweden's (and the world's) computer enthusiasts gain 
        access to free programs, but it's naturally a thorn in the side to those 
        who promote a dogmatic, capitalist system as a way if life.</font></p>

          of our well-educated populace, if it hadn't been for ftp.sunet.se&#133;

      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Here, 
        we have an obvious conflict with another part of the hacker ethic: <i>Mistrust 
        authority</i>. The answer from the established software industry becomes<i> 
        mistrust hackers</i>, which is probably justified in the cases that Bertil 
        mentions above. It is, however, hard to justify this mistrust in the case 
        of mission-critical software such as those in airplanes or medical equipment, 
        since it's impossible to find any such programs written by amateurs. The 
        companies that make such equipment are concerned with their reputation, 
        and don't hire just any hobby-hacker for just that reason. Instead, they 
        get their programmers from the more status-filled university education 
        programs.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We 
        shouldn't pay too much attention to what one person has said on one single 
        occasion. We'll instead treat it as an illustrative example. There is 
        a whole set of values that we think is God-given, but that is actually 
        not self-evident at all. It is not an obvious truth that the well-educated 
        engineer is a better builder of electronics than the kid around the corner 
        who's been a radio amateur since he could walk. More accurately, it's 
        a complete untruth. Granted, some enthusiasts migrate to the finer universities 
        and technical schools, but some of them don't like the formal and strict 
        environment they encounter <i>at all</i>. They prefer to stay at home 
        in their garages and study and experiment on their own. That kind of <i>motivation</i> 
        beats most university education by lengths, when it comes to direct practical 
        knowledge.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Of 
        course, the at-home hacker is usually an individual that isn't very socially 
        adaptable, and who also has a penchant for certain suspicious subcultures. 
        <i>That</i> is most likely the <i>true reason</i> that these skilled hackers 
        aren't hired for positions where they could do the most good. Instead, 
        they sit at home and put together freeware for any and all. (I've talked 
        about what happens in the worst cases in chapter 4 and 10, about underground 
        hackers and computer crime). A university degree is not only a certificate 
        of competence - it also indicates that its possessor is socially adept 
        and has the ability for discipline and obedience that is required at large 
        corporations. A programmer should have the ability to carry out a project 
        without questioning it. No large company is interested in employees that 
        think too independently and develop alternative solutions without permission. 
        Instead, every project is controlled from a high position within the hierarchy. 
        In short: a university degree means, in addition to competence, that the 
        bearer has accepted the authority and power structures that exist within 
        companies as well as educational institutions.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Stone 
        soups cooked by enthusiasts, with many rival solutions to one problem, 
        can beat monolithic corporations in competition. It is obvious that this 
        way of working and looking at the role of the economy in society is part 
        of the foundation of cyberpunk ideology. But here the respectable university 
        hackers enter the picture: people who live normal, family lives, but who 
        grew up with - and created - the first computers during the 70's, and 
        who are now at forefront of the explosive growth in computer development. 
        Their message is the same: Freedom of information! The rational world 
        of computing seems to influence its users in the same vein: towards efficiency, 
        decentralization, cooperation, and exchange of information, and away from 
        bickering, bureaucracy, and monotony. I say that this is good. What do 
        you think?</font></font></p>

        World of Science<br>
        </font></b></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To understand 
        how people can work their asses off without making a lot of money, one 
        must understand how the scientific virtual community works. The scientific 
        community is a society within society, with its own norms and ideals. 
        Inside, <i>prestige</i> and <i>knowledge</i> counts the most, not how 
        many stocks you own or how big your Mercedes is. Researchers, doctoral 
        students, and other scientists <i>pay</i> to have their creations evaluated 
        by other scientists, simply for the joy of sharing and promoting science. 
        </font></p>
      <p>Th<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">e view that information 
        and knowledge is public property is so inherent in this community that 
        </font><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">it 
        isn't even questioned. All this information is published in a few thousand 
        scientific journals across the world, with an extremely small distribution, 
        created <i>by</i> scientists <i>for </i>scientists. Nowadays, more and 
        more of these journals are starting to partly or completely employ electronic 
        publication as a cheaper alternative to print - even within the &quot;soft&quot; 
        sciences, such as Sociology and Psychology.&nbsp;The scientific community 
        has been created to free research and science from the social power apparatus. 
        The only way to do this is by building a culture with its own framework 
        and values, which the hackers also discovered a long time ago.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As 
        you see, the scientific virtual community share significant aspects with 
        the hackers' sub-cultural <i>Scene</i>. They exchange information freely 
        among each other, and ignore the market economy completely.<sup><a href="#FTNT10">(10)</a></sup> 
        Of course, this throws a monkey wrench into the theories of most economists, 
        since they'd rather see everyone acting according to a rational market 
        model, but the scientific community won't submit to commercialization, 
        no matter how much the rest of society wants it to. The icing on the cake 
        is that the rest of society is <i>dependent</i> on the scientific community. 
        Without science, little progress is made, and the schooling of new CEOs, 
        engineers, psychologists, etc. is completely at the mercy of scientific 
        realms. Therefore, society at large is forced to financially support these 
        scientists. Graciously, the scientists in turn support hackers and some 
        other subcultures by offering free access to computers.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Why 
        do the scientists help the hackers? Simple. They depend on them. The hackers 
        yield many of the ideas for new inventions and research areas. Additionally, 
        many of them work at the universities and technical schools. Some work 
        at the companies that sell information services, and some are even to 
        be found in the IT departments of the largest corporations.&nbsp;It is 
        actually the case that the rest of society is dependent on both the scientific 
        community and the <i>Scene</i> of the hackers. The conflicts that emerge 
        are products of the fact that the technocratic society, led by scientists 
        and hackers, is growing in power over the regular market-based society.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
        reason that the establishment wants to control the funding for the Internet 
        is, beneath the surface, a very old one: <i>it is concerned about its 
        POWER!</i></font></font></p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">Th<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">e 
        Market Paradigm</font></font></b><br>
        <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have to try to understand 
        the origins of this conflict. Our society, as it exists today, is moving 
        towards increasing levels of specialization. Our entire economic market 
        model is built on it, or rather, on <i>a constantly increasing</i> degree 
        of specialization. Productivity levels in this system must perpetually 
        grow, in order to give a number of anonymous stock owners returns on their 
        investments, so that they can buy and own even more.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If I want to develop software, 
        I need an idea. Then I have to start a company, hire as many programmers 
        as I need, and find some suitable investors. If I can't find anyone to 
        finance my venture, my idea must be a poor one, or I've been looking in 
        the wrong places. When the product is sold, I employ special services 
        for the replication, distribution, and marketing of the software.&nbsp;Any 
        CEO at any software company views the process in this manner.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The problem with this view 
        is that there's no room for creative spirit among the programmers themselves. 
        As a boss, I have to rigidly command them onto the right track. I must 
        never lose control over the end product, and if the programmers come up 
        with their own ideas, I'm of course free to listen to them, but it is 
        still <i>my</i> responsibility as a project leader to decide whether these 
        ideas will be part of the end product. There is no place for the free 
        action of the individual in the market-oriented way of thinking. Only 
        the project leader should know what really goes on with the product, while 
        the individual programmers should only be concerned with the little piece 
        they're working on. There is always an inherent hierarchy built into this 
        form of organization.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Market-economy thinking is 
        also built on a hidden method for hiding knowledge. It would be unfortunate 
        for the project leader if the programmers realized how little influence 
        they really have on the creative process. The same goes for all hierarchically 
        organized companies. The only people that have any idea of what's actually 
        occurring within a company is supposed to be the leadership. If the workers 
        are to have any information, it is transmitted through carefully designed 
        yellow sheets that are dumped in the employees' pigeonholes, in which 
        chosen parts of the company's activities are exposed in order to increase 
        motivation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We're dealing with a power 
        structure that is anything but democratic. This is the skewed balance 
        of power that is the reason that companies work better than governments. 
        The absence of democracy is very efficient. It's not a secret that the 
        democratic offensive into the Swedish business world, in the form of MBL 
        (&quot;the law of shared decisions&quot;) etc., has decreased corporate 
        efficiency.&nbsp;The workers should act under the orders of management, 
        not by its own will. Corporate management has therefore invented ingenious 
        mechanisms to limit democratic control of their companies despite these 
        new laws. These include, for example, constant reorganization in order 
        to hide the mechanisms of authority and give the workers a sense of being 
        in control of their own responsibilities.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The hacker ethic, cyberpunk 
        ideology, and technocracy stand in sharp contrast. All of these views 
        expect programmers to be creative, inventive, and <i>skeptical</i>. The 
        market economy assumes that comprehensive plans are <i>not </i>questioned 
        before they are completed. That's why companies go to great lengths to 
        hire only engineers from universities and technical schools, who have 
        by virtue of their degree been through the social indoctrination to <i>not 
        question</i>.<sup><a href="#FTNT11">(11)</a></sup> Those individuals who 
        question are sent into other parts of the machine of society: research, 
        politics, and the <i>criminal</i> <i>industry</i>, to produce information 
        of a kind that is important to society in other ways.<sup><a href="#FTNT12">(12)</a></sup></font>

      one time.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT2"></a> 2. Which has in fact become the case. I must be psychic.<br>

      <a name="FTNT3"></a> 3. Nowadays, virtually all magazines have an online 
      version. My personal favorite is &quot;Syber-Starlet&quot; (Translator's 
      note: a magazine very similar to <i>Seventeen</i>).<br>

      that the users pay for are often crack and tossed to the four winds&#133;<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT5"></a> 5. This is a generalized view that presupposes an infinite 
      number of companies, a great number of different products in the same category, 
      and that the &quot;market&quot; is an independent filter that is never deceived 
      by propaganda. This stands in very poor resemblance to reality.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT6"></a> 6. Then again, it's probably just a myth.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT7"></a> 7. At the moment Telia is undergoing a reorganization 
      which, as everyone who's studied introductory management knows, is aimed 
      at destroying the social networks that have formed in the workplace in order 
      to strengthen the upper echelons' grip on the company.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT8"></a> 8. And now Windows NT is the hot thing. And then it'll 
      be Nashville. Hum-de-hum.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT9"></a> 9. I know that the know-it-alls are being driven up 
      the walls by statements such as this. If it bothers you, write your own 
      book for those who get hung up on details.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT10"></a> 10. Pierre Bourdieu introduces the concept of &quot;cultural 
      capital&quot; in order to try to explain this trend.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT11"></a> 11. A slightly mean (and simplified) statement.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT12"></a> 12. Svante Tidholm remarked that I have an ability 
      to sometimes reduce the individual to a simple puppet for the powers that 
      be. I understand his view, but I'm not smart enough to get around the way 
      the question is posed. My respect for the capacity of the individual is 
      very great, and I also take the side of the individual in this rigged game.
