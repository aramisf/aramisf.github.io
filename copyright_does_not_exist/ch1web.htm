      <td><font face="Times New Roman"><b>This book is about currents of thought 
        in literature, technology, music, film, law and ideology. It was written 
        after I realized that if I didn't write it, somebody else would. It was 
        also written because I wanted all of the nice hackers in Sweden to be 
        aware of, and educated about, their historical and ideological heritage. 
        Finally, the work has been written with an air of popular science, to 
        make it somewhat easier to understand (although the last statement can 
        probably be debated; some chapters are considerably more difficult and 
        technical than others).</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>

        Why should I read this stuff?<br>
        </i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">To 
        understand new concepts within information society, emerging youth culture, 
        and public debate, and also to give yourself the opportunity to form your 
        own opinions through confronting those of myself and others. The book 
        is focused on cultural phenomena in particular, since they are the strongest 
        indicators of the direction of a society. </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Our</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> society, at the brink of the information 
        society, is called the </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>post-industrial</i></font>

        will also attempt to make you question that society.<br>

        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q:</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>What 
        is a computer?</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">A 
        computer is an object that obeys the laws of nature, just like a human 
        being. Like a person, it is neither evil, boring, kind, troublesome, or 
        particularly intelligent. It becomes what it is made to become, just like 
        an individual in society. The difference between a human being and a computer 
        is that the computer has the opportunity to know with certainty who has 
        created it, and it can look like virtually anything. In 1995, most people 
        think that a computer looks like a square box. The computing field distinguishes 
        between </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>microcomputers</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>minicomputers</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>mainframes</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, and </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>supercomputers</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, each being more powerful and cool than 
        the previous. Today, the lines that separate one from the other are so 
        blurry that these labels are a bit antiquated. A microcomputer, for example, 
        is a PC, Mac, or similar home computer. The average person has hardly 
        seen any of the other types.<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>What 
        is a computer network?<br>
        </i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">A 
        computer network consists of two or more independent computers that have 
        been connected by a cable. It is customary to distinguish between LANs 
        (</font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Local Area Networks</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">), where computers inside the same building 
        or at most the same block are connected, MANs (</font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Metropolitan 
        Area Networks</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">), which connect 
        computers throughout an entire city, and WANs (</font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Wide 
        Area Networks</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">), which connect 
        computers across great distances. The greatest network of them all is 
        the Internet, which links all kinds of computers - and networks - across 
        the entire world. A computer network allows for the transfer of information 
        between different computers, may it be text, images, sounds, or anything 
        that can be entered into a computer. It is similar to telephones or postal 
        transport, but better and faster. Actually, the entire phone network is 
        a computer network, except it connects people instead of computers. Many 
        WANs such as the Internet employ the phone networks instead of laying 
        their own cables. Computers that hold together a computer network are 
        almost exclusively minicomputers or mainframes, i.e. large, refrigerator-looking 
        boxes.<br>

        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>What 
        is a BBS?</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">BBS 
        stands for </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Bulletin Board System</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, which really means an electronic bulletin 
        or poster board. Similar to a regular bulletin board, it is necessary 
        to visit it frequently to see its contents. You can also put up your own 
        &quot;notices&quot; and receive replies to your submissions through other 
        written messages on the board. There are BBSs that are partially connected 
        to the Internet, and some that are stand-alone. Today, you connect to 
        a BBS through the use of a modem, a computer, and a telephone line. In 
        the future, BBSs will probably be replaced by conferencing systems (a 
        type of giant BBS) on the vastly more efficient Internet. Newsgroups are 
        an example of such conferencing systems. Users can also send private electronic 
        mail to each other or mass-distribute computer software through a BBS.<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Q: </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>What 
        is Cyberspace?<br>
        </i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>A: </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">Cyberspace 
        is where the money you keep in the bank resides. It is where a telephone 
        conversation takes place and the space through which television programs 
        travel on their way to your receiver. It is an electronic reality consisting 
        of information, and it actually only exists because people have agreed 
        that it works. Physically speaking, it consists of cables, radio waves, 
        pulses of light and large computers with gigantic memory capacities. It 
        is a physical occurrence in the &quot;real&quot; world that we may, with 
        an ounce of faith, consider a universe of its own. It is a reality in 
        which man is God and has created all. It is something of a religion. Most 
        people &quot;believe&quot; in cyberspace, or they wouldn't use an ATM 
        to withdraw currency. The entire economic system of the West exists inside 
        it. Cyberspace was born on March 10, 1876, when Alexander Greham Bell 
        &quot;invented&quot; it. Without electricity, there is no cyberspace. 
        Our civilization is already dependent on cyberspace; if it disappeared, 
        the economy would collapse and the West would perish.</font></td>
