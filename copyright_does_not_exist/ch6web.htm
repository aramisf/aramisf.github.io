        Heritage College Dictionary</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        defines electronic music as follows: &quot;Music produced or altered by 
        electronic means, as by a tape recorder or synthesizer.&quot;</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Electronic music 
        has long existed as a subculture within &quot;real music&quot;, especially 
        in Sweden. In 1948 (the same year that <b>IBM</b> started marketing the 
        first commercial computer) a certain <b>Pierre Schaeffer</b> created the 
        first electronic music composition, which he called<i> &#201;tudes aux 
        Chemins de Fer </i>(Etudes for Trains). Electronic music was born in his 
        studio for <i>Musique Concr&#232;te</i> (Concrete Music) at Radio France. 
        Concrete music is music that is not limited to pure tones, and incorporates 
        sounds from everyday life, such as long, continually changing notes without 
        tone quality, etc. In 1952-53, the musician <b>Karlheinz Stockhausen </b>worked 
        with Schaeffer, and brought some of Schaeffer's ideas home to Germany. 
        Since then, this form of music has spread and is on the curriculum at 
        different public institutions as a very small branch of classical music. 
        As opposed to Schaeffer, who preferred to work with taped recordings of 
        real sounds such as those of trains or birds, Stockhausen focused on using 
        only electronically created sounds. In Sweden, this music form was basically 
        unknown until it was introduced in <b>Harry Martinsson</b>'s science-fiction 
        opera <i>Aniara</i> in 1959.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This chapter is not about 
        classical electronic music - there are plenty of texts on the subject. 
        Furthermore, this book is aimed at regular people who think that art should 
        reflect something, i.e. that one should not constantly try to break out 
        of existing concepts and conceptual systems to appear as incomprehensible 
        as possible. Electronic music is a form in which the music has to be interpreted 
        on more levels than the musical. In other words: this book will stick 
        to a broader aspect of popular culture. This is not to say that the art 
        of electronic music is not interesting; it is just not particularly interesting 
        for the purpose of this book.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is unnecessary to point 
        out that the history of electronic music stretches farther back than the 
        history of hacker culture. However, the phenomenon of electronic music 
        has had a profound influence on hacker culture, and in its pop-culture 
        manifestation in the forms of synth-pop, techno, acid, house, etc., it 
        has played an important role for the generation that grew up with computers. 
        One of its main uses has been to display the beautiful side of the computer. 
        Electronic music was the first area in which computers were used to create 
        art, and as opposed to other forms of electronic culture, electronic music 
        has its roots in Europe.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first time a computer 
        played music was in 1957, at Bell Labs in the United States. The song 
        was called <i>Daisy</i>, which is the same piece that the intelligent 
        computer <i>HAL</i> (in <b>Stanley Kubrick</b>'s film version of <b>Arthur 
        C. Clarke</b>'s science fiction novel <i>2001</i>) starts humming as it 
        is being disassembled. Naturally, this is not a coincidence, but rather 
        the intention of the director to return the computer to its &quot;childhood 
        state&quot; (in a double sense) as it loses its advanced electronic identity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The world in the 70's and 
        80's: With the introduction of the first cheap Japanese synthesizers, 
        regular people (who were not trained musicians) started using electronic 
        instruments, and electronic pop music was born. The difference between, 
        for example, the Hammond organ or Pink Floyd's monophonic synthesizers 
        and the new generation of electronic instruments was that the latter could 
        store rhythms and entire pieces of songs in their digital memory, which 
        could later be modified. In particular, quantization (which adapts notes 
        played to a given rhythm) was (and is) greatly criticized by &quot;serious&quot; 
        musicians. They thought that simple and rhythmically perfect melodies 
        were destructive to music, and they distanced themselves from it. Another 
        factor that abhorred musicians of the old school was that music played 
        by machines would not be limited by the dexterity of a given musician, 
        which allowed the ability of the ear to perceive sound variations to set 
        the limits for the music. A &quot;groove&quot; of several hundred beats 
        a minute, or pieces with tone lengths of several hundredths of seconds 
        - songs like those scare the living daylights out of musicians who are 
        accustomed to being able to analyze the music they listen to.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For the new electronic musicians, 
        the perfect quantization, the possibility of a high pace, and synthetic 
        &quot;sound images&quot; constituted a measure of beauty. Among the pioneers, 
        the most notable was the German band <b>Kraftwerk</b>, who built their 
        own synthesizers and should be considered classics of the genre. Kraftwerk's 
        importance for synth music can hardly be exaggerated. No single group 
        has had as much influence on electronic pop music as these futurists - 
        futurists in the sense that they saw the inherent beauty of the technology, 
        rather than a tool for reproducing other ideals. They made contact with 
        the previuosly named Karlehinz Stockhausen at an early stage, and drew 
        lots of ideas and inspiration from classical electronic music.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Kraftwerk, and in particular 
        its member <b>Ralf H&#252;tter</b>, are also extremely politically aware 
        and openly supports hackers. Sometimes, Ralf even refers to himself as 
        a hacker. The mentality of these German gentlemen has thus influenced 
        - and been influenced by - the digital underground culture around the 
        world. Chaos Computer Club member Pengo, who was previously mentioned 
        in connection with illegal hackers, was a Kraftwerk fan, and he listened 
        to their records over and over while breaking into computers around the 
        globe. He was not alone in this. Even though hackers in general have disparate 
        musical tastes, from Bach to death metal, there are few who do not enjoy 
        electronic music in some form or another.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">While a &quot;normal&quot; 
        educated musician perhaps sees the computer as a tool for producing compositions, 
        musical arrangements, and nice-looking sheet music, a futuristic musician 
        sees the computer as an instrument, something to be played by its own 
        right, and which - like a saxophone or a harp - possesses an inner beauty. 
        The futuristic musician can sit for hours and adjust different parameters 
        to extract personal sounds from the machine, and he/she loves it as much 
        as a guitarist loves to extrapolate his/her scales up and down in the 
        search for a greater personal touch.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">While a &quot;normal&quot; 
        musician creates his or her profile through finding new techniques to 
        manipulate his/her existing instrument, the electronic musician works 
        with numeric parameters, spectrum analyzers, and one-handed play. Some 
        don't know how to play an instrument at all, and stick to writing the 
        music note by note in something like a &quot;musical word processor&quot;. 
        The method may be radically distinct from traditional music creation, 
        but that doesn't mean that electro-pop has less 'soul&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Peter Samson</b>, as one 
        of the very first hackers at MIT (yes, we're back there again), had managed 
        to get a PDP-1 computer to play Bach fugues solely based on numerical 
        input. His program could be said to be the first sequencer made by an 
        amateur. A sequencer is a computer program or a machine that remembers 
        the notes to be played, and allows the user to change the notes, replay 
        them, then store them again to replay them at some other time. Since that 
        day, we have enjoyed a living, machine-made music culture. Many musicians 
        of the old school react with outright xenophobia against this new way 
        of working with music, rather than enjoy its benefits and try to understand 
        what the point is.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Among Swedish electro-pioneers 
        there was <b>Page</b> (which is still an active band). During the early 
        80's the group was one of the first (and for its genre, also one of the 
        most successful) so-called synth-pop groups. Many jumped on the synth 
        bandwagon, but have presently been forgotten. Who listens to groups like 
        <b>Trans-X</b>, <b>Ultravox</b>, or <b>Texas Instruments</b> today? Not 
        many, even if there are still quite a few synth-pop fans around the country. 
        The genre has returned in the form of groups such as <b>S.P.O.C.K.</b> 
        or newcomers <b>Children Within</b>, which are both very talented Swedish 
        bands.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As a reaction against the 
        frequently well-groomed and &quot;nice&quot; synth bands (read: Howard 
        Jones, Depeche Mode, etc.) that flourished in the mid-80's, there came 
        a new and incredibly heavy form of synth music: Electric Body Music, or 
        simply <i>EBM</i>. Mostly, it was just referred to as &quot;raw synth&quot;. 
        The English band <b>Cabaret Voltair</b> had &quot;invented&quot; the style 
        in 1978, but it was not until now that it reached popularity on the Continent 
        and in America. Among others, <b>Portion Control</b>, <b>Front 242</b> 
        (who coined the term EBM), <b>Skinny Puppy</b>, and <b>Invincible Spirit</b> 
        joined the trend. One can compare the arrival of heavy synth music to 
        the introduction of grunge (personified by Nirvana) as a reaction to &quot;poodle 
        rock&quot; - there were simply too much corny stuff out there. Less successful 
        was perhaps the tendency of many heavy synth bands to flirt with nazi 
        symbolism and clothing, and many groups (including Front 242) had to make 
        public statements denying any connection to or support of neo-nazi movements.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the 90's, many groups have 
        grown weary of the EBM concept, since it started to become a bit trite. 
        For example, <b>Ministry</b>, <b>Die Krupps</b>, and the Swedish band 
        <b>Poupp&#233; Fabrikk</b> had switched to Crossover, a type of music 
        that mixes EBM and different types of metal, often in the style of the 
        trash-metal pioneers <b>Metallica</b>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Ambient</b><br>
        In 1978, the former Roxy Music keyboard player<b> Brian Eno</b> released 
        a record named <i>Music for Airports</i>, using his own record company 
        called Ambient. Ambient is originally an esoteric form of artistic music. 
        The underlying idea is to produce a complete environment rather than just 
        a musical &quot;sound carpet&quot; with rhythms and ordered notes. Naturally, 
        it is advantageous to create a sound image from an unfamiliar and exciting 
        environment if one is interested in making quality, penetrating ambient 
        music. A simple method for creating ambient music is to just set up a 
        couple of microphones in a steel mill, a suburban apartment, or whatever 
        environment you want to incorporate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Eno supposedly got the idea 
        for making such music after being hospitalized following a car accident. 
        He was confined to the bed with the stereo on, unable to get up to either 
        turn it off or turn up the volume. The silent whisper of music combined 
        with the sounds from the street below made him realize that this was actually 
        a real music style. Peripheral music - like the music we listen to in 
        supermarkets or airports - contains its own logic and does not at all 
        resemble &quot;regular&quot; music. Ambient music is music that should 
        be listened to while doing something else, concentrating on other sounds, 
        yet it should be subconsciously enjoyable. In psychology, the phenomenon 
        is classified as subliminal perception. The music creates a totality together 
        with external sounds and does not place requirements on the listener's 
        attention.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Eno didn't actually &quot;invent&quot; 
        ambient music. The eccentric and ingenious composer Erik Satie made a 
        few less-appreciated attempts at creating &quot;furniture music&quot; 
        in the early 1900s, and in the 60's, the musical artist <b>John Cage</b> 
        wrote <i>Four Minutes, Thirty-three Seconds</i>, a piece for silent piano, 
        which is considered by many to be the ultimate ambient composition. The 
        point was that the listener should concentrate on the sounds in his or 
        her environment. To get the most out of the piece, one should perhaps 
        read the score. Cage also worked with electronic music, where he introduced 
        ideas from Zen philosophy about how the music should be organized but 
        still display a chaotic nature. These ideas have, served as a basis for 
        the study of improvisational techniques. They have also had a great influence 
        on ambient music, and this is mentioned on the covers of Brian Eno's records.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Together with installation 
        art, this music form says a great deal about ambitions within modern art: 
        to create a total environment and place the beholder inside it<sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>. 
        The concept of Virtual Reality is considered to be the optimal combination 
        of installation art and ambient music. An artificial, man-made environment 
        of the type that writers for ages have been able to create using the reader's 
        imagination - but tangible, detailed, and accurate. A world built on pure 
        information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Electronic music pioneers 
        such as <b>Tangerine Dream</b> (which debuted with <i>Electronic Meditation</i> 
        in 1969), and some symphonic rock groups like <b>Hawkwind</b>, experimented 
        early on with creating alien, futuristic sound environments using early 
        synthesizers and manipulating all types of electronic equipment (for example, 
        guitar amplifiers) to produce strange sounds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Brian Eno is still a prominent 
        figure in ambient music. Before ambient music became well-known, it was 
        often filed under labels such as New Age or Meditational. These terms 
        are nowadays used for artists like Jean-Michel Jarre and Vangelis, who 
        represent a sort of mood-charged elevator-style music, suitable for active 
        as well as passive listening.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Modern DJ's such as <b>Alex 
        Paterson</b> and <b>Bill Drummond</b> (The Orb/KLF) and <b>Sven V&#228;th</b>, 
        inspired by techno and industrial music, have succeeded in the art of 
        making rhythmical pop music with elements of ambient music without ruining 
        the basic concept. Especially The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld 
        and V&#228;th's Accident in Paradise are considered important milestones 
        in &quot;modern&quot; ambient</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> <b>Electronic Film</b><br>
        The last subject I will touch upon in this chapter is not about music. 
        Electronic film has existed basically since the introduction of the TV, 
        but never developed into a genre of its own until the late 80's. We can 
        compare electronic film to electronic music, and define it as film that 
        is created only by electronic means. The first time anything of the kind 
        was done was when a TV camera was aimed at a TV screen, and thus created 
        a flowing feedback pattern. That type of effect has also been used in 
        music, to spiff up a melody and add new dimensions; there's hardly a guitarist 
        that does not know how to employ feedback in an electronic amplifier to 
        create new sounds.</font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For 
        music, this form of manipulation came about as early as the mid-50's through 
        Stockhausen. For TV and film, it was never a matter of making electronic 
        film its own art form. Instead, technology was mostly used to create special 
        effects. A shining example is the vignette for the English TV series <i>Doctor 
        Who</i>, an illusion of a trip through a long, colorful tunnel, created 
        solely with the help of feedback patterns.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The art of filmmaking has 
        developed in many directions, but electronic film in particular seems 
        to repel many filmmakers. In film, there is no tradition of creating pictures 
        without people. Since its inception, film has been based on theater, and 
        thus on dialogue. The mere thought of making a film without people is 
        absurd to most directors (<i>Translator's note: </i>and then <i>Star Wars: 
        The Phantom Menace</i> came along...). In music there is, to say the least, 
        a much older tradition of making music without song. One could say that 
        music, as opposed to theater and film, has more to do with directly generating 
        emotions and moods than trying to reflect real events or psychological 
        occurrences.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In animated pictures, there 
        have been several attempts to take a step away from people and trying 
        to create a symbolic universe. Mostly, however, it has only led to compromise. 
        Virtually all animated films are fables, i. e. they describe things that 
        actually occur in human society. Basically all events that are described 
        in cartoons involve actors with certain human physical and psychological 
        attributes that have been put in some human-like situation. The few attempts 
        at creating animated film like modern art, through the use of symbols 
        and patterns without &quot;life&quot;, have almost exclusively produced 
        incomprehensible results.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Also relevant is the fact 
        that film, up until the 90's, was extremely expensive to produce and did 
        not lend itself to frivolous experimentation. It was necessary to have 
        an established market potential or government financing to afford to make 
        a movie. Neither of these institutions is very receptive to experimental 
        ideas. With the introduction of cheap video technology in the late 80's 
        and early 90's, it became possible to experiment with film in an entirely 
        new way.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The computer has also made 
        an appearance in electronic film. Here, as in music, it is the general 
        opinion that the computer should remain merely a tool, a means of creating 
        completely normal commercial or artistic film. Among those involved with 
        animation and computer graphics, ideas are radically different. One of 
        the most distinct and beautiful examples of electronic film is a series 
        of short movies created by George Lucas' <i>PIXAR</i>, a company that 
        was founded by the film mogul for the sole purpose of developing computer 
        technology for motion pictures. It goes under the collective name of <i>Beyond 
        the Mind's Eye</i>, and is well appreciated among those who already have 
        been involved with electronic culture. Somewhat paradoxically, in this 
        case it was the commercial film industry that financed the development 
        of one of the most alternative art forms there is. Some of PIXAR's movies 
        are regular movies intended for a wide audience (like cartoons but more 
        detailed), while others are very experimental<sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I refer to films containing 
        only exploding geometric figures, camera pans over incomprehensible landscapes, 
        fractal images, and psychedelic color patterns as ambient films, since 
        the idea is about the same as with ambient music - to set a mood without 
        a linear or coherent content. The style is related to so-called parametric 
        film, in which the technique, especially camera positioning and panning, 
        is and end in itself to lend the film a certain mood without resorting 
        to traditional narrative methods.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Electronic film is very popular 
        at rave parties, and also a given ingredient in many techno music videos, 
        a music style which will be discussed in the next chapter.<br>
