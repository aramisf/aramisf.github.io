        about something that is horribly overestimated, but inevitably influential 
        when it comes to the future - at least when viewed as a phenomenon. I 
        hesitated for a long time before deciding to include virtual reality (VR) 
        in this book, but I realized that it obviously belonged to the subject 
        of electronic culture. The reason for my hesitancy is that this area of 
        research has been so hyped up and misunderstood that it has assumed almost 
        religious proportions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Virtual reality was originally a term that 
        meant imagined reality. It's the same sort of reality that role-playing 
        enthusiasts occupy when they navigate an imaginary world. In its original 
        form, this artificial environment requires a considerable degree of imagination 
        and patience. VR has progressed from traditional pen-and-paper role-playing 
        games to interactive role-playing games on the Internet, so-called <b>MUD</b>s 
        (Multi-User Dungeons), and not until the 90's did the term become synonymous 
        with the technology that allows the creation of realities using computer-generated 
        sound and graphics. In a MUD, a certaain protocol is established in order 
        to communicate directly with other people, which uses a language that 
        is an extension of the written word. It is possible to state which way 
        one wishes to communicate with a fellow player. For example, one can make 
        clear the one wishes an utterance to be taken ironically, coldly, or erotically. 
        One could write: &quot;Say 'hiya!' in a humorous manner to X&quot;, by 
        which X receives a message like this: &quot;Y says 'hiya!' to you in a 
        humorous manner&quot;. It is also possible to strike poses, and to emote 
        feelings. You might receive a message such as: &quot;Y smiles an ironic 
        smile&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This mode of communication over the Internet 
        has had a decisive influence on the language that is used in written debate 
        in the electronic universe. The most well-known conventions include the 
        sign for humor, :-) (a smiley-face, sideways), and the sign for irony, 
        ;-) (a winking smiley-face), as well as writing in ALL CAPITALS to indicate 
        shouting. In addition to these, a slew of more or less commonly accepted 
        symbols has arisen. This is the first step towards network-based transmission 
        of symbols with another meaning than the purely linguistic. It creates 
        the first possibility of using &quot;tone of voice&quot; and body language 
        in artificial worlds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is an extension 
        of MUDs. It is possible to do pretty much the same things in IRC as on 
        a MUD, except it's a little closer to reality. Some set up private IRC 
        conferences and chat within an exclusive group, while others spend their 
        time on some of the many open groups, such as #Sweden, which works sort 
        of like a text version of phone chat, for Swedish speakers. Today, about 
        1,000 Swedes use IRC on a regular basis.<sup><a href="#FTNT1">(1)</a></sup> 
        IRC has a rigid technocratic hierarchy in which those who know more about 
        the system have more power, and can push other people around about as 
        much as they please. Democracy doesn't exist: on every channel there's 
        a number of &quot;royalty&quot; (so-called chan-ops, or channel operators) 
        who sometimes &quot;fight&quot; for control over the channel. In IRC there 
        is also the possibility of conducting information trading, which entails 
        trading information using one simple command: <i>/dcc send nick file</i>. 
        IRC has already developed into a subculture, with its own values and pecking 
        orders. A surprising number of women use IRC.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This technology is just the first step of 
        a progression that will take us to infinitely more sophisticated forms 
        of communication than we know today. In experimental facilities, the imaginary 
        environments become more and more real, so much that many have started 
        to question the difference between real and imaginary reality, concluding 
        that it is mostly a matter of definition. But let's start at the beginning.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">No single person has been more important 
        to virtual reality as <b>Jaron Lanier</b>. Jaron moved to California in 
        1981, with the intention of living as a hippie and playing the flute on 
        the streets. Instead, he stumbled into a job as computer game programmer. 
        After some time in the field, he started a company called <b>VPL</b> (Visual 
        Programming Languages) with his own money and started a non-profit project 
        which involved developing a programming language. Programming languages 
        are the languages that people use to communicate with computers and tell 
        them what to do, Examples of common programming languages include BASIC 
        (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), Pascal (after the mathematician 
        of the same name), and C (named by someone who thought the naming conventions 
        for programming languages had gotten out of hand).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Now, Jaron didn't want to write any old 
        programming language, but THE programming language. He thought programming 
        was one of the most fun things he knew, but it was reserved for an all-too-small 
        group of people. He thought everyone should be able to program. Instead 
        of just allowing a tiny elite of programmers to build mathematical and 
        symbolic models of reality, he wanted to place this tool in the hands 
        of the common man, with a minimal amount of prerequisite knowledge. The 
        language was finally named <i>Mandala</i>. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many people that try using a computer for 
        the first time thinks the whole thing is too abstract and contains too 
        many theoretical concepts. A computer student I had once said: </font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;You can tell me that this here 
          is a command, and that it has this and that property and works in such 
          and such a way. It's like telling me that this is a hammer, and it works 
          like so. I'll never understand unless I get to hold the hammer.&quot;</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> He hit the nail on the head. If people 
        won't adapt to computers, then computers would have to adapt to people. 
        If Mohammed won't come to the mountain, the mountain will have to come 
        to Mohammed. That was Jaron's idea: make the computing environment as 
        real as possible, remove that keyboard if it causes so much frustration, 
        and take away that two-dimensional screen if flat symbols are so hard 
        to understand. Create an entire reality around the user so that he or 
        she feels at home. The concept of virtual reality was born. Of course, 
        this idea was not entirely new. The first time the concept of VR came 
        up was supposedly in 1965, through <b>Ivan Sutherland</b> at Utah university. 
        But Jaron was the first one to try to realize these ideas, and make <i>money</i> 
        off them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">VPL was founded in 1985. Since then, nothing's 
        been the same. In 1991, us regular people made our first acquaintance 
        with VR as <b>W Industries </b>released its computer game <i>Virtuality</i> 
        everywhere. Newspapers, radio, TV - everyone told the story about this 
        new and fantastic invention. It was also at thaat time that people started 
        making comparisons to William Gibson's novel, <i>Neuromancer</i>, and 
        discovered obvious similarities between the way the lead character, Case, 
        connected his brain to a computer to enter cyberspace, and the gols of 
        VR. That was when people seriously started questioning the direction our 
        society was heading, and it is also among the reasons that William Gibson 
        is such an important writer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">All of it is not as strange as it is sometimes 
        presented. By applying sensors to the body that register all its movements, 
        the computer can sense how you move about and then generate sound and 
        visual impressions that agree with the way we're used to perceiving reality. 
        The sound is created by a quadrophonic sound system that allows us to 
        place sound spatially, and images are displayed three-dimensinally since 
        the computer draws an image for each eye. This is VR today; no more, no 
        less. Objects can be perceived as three-dimensional and sounds can be 
        generated as to make us think they came from the object in question. Nothing 
        strange there, just normal manipulation of our sensory capacities, just 
        like a computer screen or a loudspeaker, only more sophisticated and refined. 
        Machine-generated hallucinations or tangible dreams are other possible 
        terms for the technique.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Jaron, then, envisioned VR as a form of 
        programming language, primarily intended for creating models to facilitate 
        research and education, and to make the capacities of the computer more 
        accessible. This is not exactly how it turned out. Some inventions have 
        the ability to shock their inventors by turning out to have applications 
        far wider in scope than the inventor could ever dream about. Nuclear power 
        is probably the most frightening example of this. VR was transformed from 
        a programming language into a <i>medium</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We have a handful of media in our society. 
        We have various sorts of literature. We have theater and film. We have 
        radio and television. We also have <i>multimedia</i>, like computer games 
        and <i>hypertext</i>, which is a kind of improved text that allows us 
        to read textlike a database instead of like a book. And now we have VR, 
        and that too is a form of medium. More specifically, it is the most powerful 
        medium that humankind has ever created. VR envelops you in all dimensions 
        and commands your complete attention, just as if it was your real life 
        that was involved. You can run, but you <i>cannot possibly hide</i> from 
        it. (Imagine what a fascinating medium for commercials: Depends diapers 
        chase you into a corner and suffocate you to death.)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Jaron was well underway with his project, 
        he realized that he needed help to complete it. He enlisted the aid of 
        the MIT media lab, which had already helped in enlightening the world 
        through the <i>graphical interface</i>. (An interface is the set of things 
        that exist as a bridge between the computer and the user, like the screen 
        and the mouse). This was later to be used by Xerox, Macintosh, and Microsoft 
        (in that order), and we nowadays know it under such product names as <i>System 
        7 </i>and <i>Windows</i>. The military got into the action, as usual. 
        They had already experimented with flight simulators to train pilots before 
        sending them into action. VR was viewed as a possibility of improving 
        the simulators, and even to develop very accurate systems for <i>remote 
        presence</i>, in which a pilot might be able to steer a plane into enemy 
        territory while physically being located in a bunker back home in HQ. 
        Such a system would be an economical way of maintaining pilot ranks, as 
        well as permitting them to build planes that could stand physical stress 
        way beyond the tolerance of any human pilot. Like RC planes, but cooler 
        (and much more dangerous). Therefore, the military blew a huge load of 
        money on VR research. War, as always, has a way of making technological 
        research move by quantum leaps and bounds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's difficult to say what importance VR 
        will have in the future, In a way , it changes nothing - we all experience 
        VR every night, in dreaming. The difference is that in VR we can control 
        the content, and employ highly <i>tangible</i> dreams for our own purposes. 
        One of the greatest areas of VR application is therefore in psychology, 
        since dreams has a primary importance in the study of the human mind. 
        It is quite reasonable to expect VR to be used in very sophisticated therapy. 
        <i>Or</i> brainwashing, if that's what's desired. Brainwashing is not 
        always a negative thing; in inpatient psychiatric care, rapists and killers 
        are treated with a very advanced form of brainwashing to cure pathological 
        behaviors. Such care can certainly be improved and become more effective 
        with VR. Conversely, VR can be abused.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a medium, VR holds enormous potential. 
        When we communicate across electronic links, we don't feel as if we actually 
        meet someone. The anonymity that goes with a telephone receiver allows 
        us to spit out the most daring utterances, since we don't feel physically 
        intimidated. When we speak on the phone, we are constantly distracted 
        by other events in our surroundings. When we communicate via Internet, 
        it is impossible to use any form of real body language or tone of voice. 
        The only way to communicate feelings in an electronic conference is by 
        writing lightning-quick and misspelled sentences to express upset, or 
        using typographical conventions to communicate states of mind.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In VR, we can use as much body language 
        as we want to. We can make the encounter totally similar to reality, as 
        if we were meeting in the same room. We can make it <i>more</i> than real 
        - we can inflate ourselves to twice our size if we want. We can disguise 
        ourselves as anyone, and decide exactly what the room should look like. 
        I can experience it as if we're at your place, and you could feel as if 
        you were at my place. We can actually be in two places at once, so that 
        both of us feel at home! (Translator's note: the old line that goes &quot;your 
        place or mine&quot; would become obsolete.). I could be at a steel mill, 
        with the noise in the background, and you can be in the forest listening 
        to the birds singing. I think you're sitting on a treestump, and you think 
        I'm sitting on an anvil. Anything's possible.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In sociology, the science that studies the 
        relations between humans, the concept of <i>symbols</i> is used to denote 
        that exchange of information between people that goes deeper than language. 
        As opposed to language, such symbolisms cannot at present be stored or 
        synthesized. This is one reason for inventing written languages. A language 
        that can be stored enables a cultural heritage that spans generations, 
        and gives humanity a so-called <i>collective consciousness</i>. The concept 
        of a <i>symbol</i> includes, in addition to spoken and written language, 
        body language such as glances and involuntary movements (in linguistics, 
        gestures and such are called <i>paralinguistics</i>).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Symbolic language between people consists 
        of genetic as well as learned components. Animals that cannot speak or 
        write communicate exclusively through &quot;primitive&quot; symbolisms 
        of the sort I just mentioned. Symbols can be thought of as the bonds that 
        tie people together in groups, societies, and entire systems of societies. 
        Not unexpectedly, symbols figure heavily in AI research; most AI researchers 
        view all of a person's consciousness as the construct of a flow of symbols 
        in one form or another, and intelligence itself as one great information-processing 
        system. (But I've already talked about that&#133;)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The goal of virtual reality is that all 
        symbols should be able to be stored and synthesized. It's supposed to 
        become the perfect medium of communication between people - even better 
        than reality. And this is perhaps what makes it so frightening. The computer 
        offers the possibility of twisting symbolic language. If you control the 
        computer, you could use it to appear as great and conceited as possible, 
        and your own picture of reality would be distorted so that other people 
        appeared as dorks. The line between illusion and reality could become 
        fuzzy indeed. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is completely impossible to predict what 
        this would do to our way of perceiving the world, and other persons in 
        particular; the only thing that's certain is that it <i>will</i> change. 
        Sometimes, people speak of the cultural or sociological <i>atomic bomb</i>, 
        where VR is a threat that could destroy all our norms or even our entire 
        perception of reality. Any prediction in this field at present must be 
        considered pure speculation, since no one communicates by VR to any great 
        degree.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, sci-fi authors already warn us 
        of the dangers of VR. One of the first examples is Philip K. Dick's short 
        story called <i>Wholesale Memories</i>, later made into the movie <i>Total 
        Recall</i>, and other examples include the <i>Illuminatus!<sup><a href="#FTNT2">(2)</a></sup></i> 
        trilogy, our beloved <i>X-Files</i>, and the movie <i>Videodrome</i> (1982). 
        All of these are based on the horrific scenario of not knowing what is 
        real and what is imagined<sup><a href="#FTNT3">(3)</a></sup> - in other 
        words, <i>paranoia</i> based on reality. I have myself written a short 
        story in this vein, and begun another which I never completed:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;Sometime that year, a group of 
          eager scientists inserted the first Carcer chip into the skull of a 
          deaf-dumb and quadraplegic test subject. When the affluent layers of 
          society gradually migrated towards a better, artificial world, these 
          slaves, people whose will would never make itself known due to the iron 
          grip of the Carcer chip, would be left behind to run the power plants, 
          the farms, the food processing plants, and all the other necessary societal 
          institutions.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>Many free persons understood that the 
          Carcer project was inhumane fromk beginning to end, that the people 
          in the bonds of the chip no longer had a will of their own. Yet they 
          were reluctant to leave the material well-being that they had built 
          for years in a world that didn't exist. Their brains were connected 
          to the machines by electrodes, and their peripheral nervous systems 
          with its arms, legs, and eyes, were disconnected. Physically, they lived 
          out their days suspended in a tank filled with isolating liquid kept 
          at body temperature.</i></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i>The freedom of a number of less privileged 
          individuals was worth sacrificing for the free men and women that now 
          lived in invulnerable bodies made of data, and who mentally controlled 
          political events. (&#133;bla bla bla)&quot;</i></font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">But - to be honest - don't worry. People 
        are rather sensible beings, all things considered. There is no reason 
        to suspect that we wouldn't be able to exploit this new resource in a 
        reasonable fashion. However, virtual reality in combination with AI gives 
        us a new picture of the importance of human beings vs. society, which 
        is the subject of chapter 15.<br>
