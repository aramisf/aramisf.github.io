      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><b>I'm going to start</b> by telling 
        you what it cost me to create this book: lots. Lots of time, and in actuality, 
        lots of money. I'm not complaining. I've had plenty of both. A large part 
        of the book was written during a phase of my studies at a vocational college. 
        It's therefore more or less financed by the public means in the form of 
        student financial aid that I received at the time. In a way, you could 
        propose that due to this fact the book belongs to society. The question 
        is whether society wants to have it.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When you publish a book in a conventional 
        manner, i. e. through a publisher, there is always some kind of quality 
        control. People with many years of experience in the field read the material 
        and ascertain that the content is both well formulated and well motivated. 
        The problem is that they also make sure that the content is, as we say, 
        &quot;politically correct&quot;, i. e. that no one will take inordinate 
        offense at it. If a publisher releases obviously inappropriate books, 
        it will suffer from badwill. This is why obviously well-written and even 
        more obviously <i>portentous</i> books such as <i>Mein Kampf</i> are printed 
        and distributed by smaller publishers that don't have to worry so much 
        about their reputation.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I don't know if any publisher wants 
        to release this book in print, but I leave this as a possibility. If I 
        haven't received an offer within a year or so, I'll release this book 
        under public domain, which means that it will always be free of copyright. 
        Until then, the following applies to this material:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"> 1: It will be absolutely free 
          in electronic form. It may be copied and distributed through media such 
          as diskettes, CD-ROMs, through BBSs and the Internet, and through public 
          and private organizations without any prior permission from me. I would, 
          however, be <i>grateful</i> for receiving a reference copy in case the 
          book would be mass distributed. <b>These terms will not be altered if 
          a publisher prints the book.</b> I do not intend to commit to a contract 
          with anyone who wants the electronic rights to its content.<br>
          <br>
          2. At the moment it is <b>not</b> permissible to mass-distribute the 
          book in printed form without my prior permission. If you want to print 
          a large run of this book I'm sure I wont have a problem with it, but 
          I'm afraid I need to retain control over this process.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Now that you've read this far, 
        you probably realize that I give you free reign in general terms. The 
        distribution of this book is your responsibility too, and the sound of 
        its message is already ringing in your ear. Put it on disks and give it 
        to your friends. Put it on CDs and distribute it with magazines. Print 
        it out on paper if you want to.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">With the exception of electronic 
        and personal use, this work is currently (and ironically) copyright-protected. 
        In an earlier version of this preface I came down on the entire capitalist 
        system, and elaborated on how much I hated attempts to treat information 
        as property. I've now settled down a little and realized that if my thoughts 
        are going to have a chance to reach ordinary people through an established 
        publisher, I must be able to give that publisher some competitive advantages.<sup><a href="#FTNT1">(1)</a></sup> 
        I'm not a utopianist; therefore, I have to make compromises. (And I'll 
        be damned if I'll lose any sleep over it&#133;)</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Finally, I will issue the warning 
        that my own values and opinions heavily influence this book. I'm a declared 
        individualist, and I don't mind being called a socialist. At the intersection 
        of these two values there is a little-known ideology called syndicalism 
        or Kropotkin anarchism. Basically, I consider all private property to 
        be equivalent to theft<sup><a href="#FTNT2">(2)</a></sup>, but I'm not 
        so bloody stupid that I don't realize that a society without private property 
        is a utopia. My opinions on freedom of speech and of the press are similar 
        to those of the most liberal organizations in Sweden. I have nothing against 
        small and medium-sized companies, but to me, enormous intercontinental 
        corporations are more dangerous factions of power than democratic governments, 
        and as such, corporations must be subject to the same oversight as that 
        for governmental organizations.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">I'm now going to tell you about 
        the culture that made me what I am.</font> </p>
      <hr>
      <font color="#666666"><a name="FTNT1"></a> 1. I have now realized that compromises 
      are worthless in this context.<br>
      <br>
      <a name="FTNT2"></a> 2. Private material property is theft. &quot;Intellectual 
      property&quot; is even worse, possibly armed robbery. Censorship is rape.</font></td>
