        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>HACKER... </b></font> 
          <font face="Times New Roman">the word itself has an air of magic, and 
          many connotations. Some associate it with computer crime, intrusion, 
          and espionage. Others imagine a skinny and myopic teenager, whose acned 
          face is constantly illuminated by the glare of a computer screen. Many 
          immediately think of the information officer at work. In recent years, 
          some have even embraced the hacker as a hero. Personally, I see the 
          hacker as a messenger sent by humanity to explore the worlds of information. 
          This mission may seem superficial and self-imposed - perhaps even foolish 
          - but it will make more and more sense the more you read on.</font> 
        </p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The word originally applied to the people 
        who spent their time crawling under the railroad tracks at the Tech Model 
        Railroad Club's (TMRC) facilities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
        (MIT) in the 1950's, connecting switches and relays with cables. This 
        model railroad was one of the first computer-like structures. A </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><i>hack</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        originally meant a prank of the kind that students and faculty played 
        on their school (or rivaling institutions), such as wrapping the entire 
        roof in tinfoil. A good hack would be very conspicuous, and also prompt 
        the observer to ask him- or herself: </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>&quot;How 
        in the hell did they do that!?&quot;.</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        Later, the word became synonymous with a spectacular solution to a technical 
        problem, or an ingenious computer program, or some other generally brilliant 
        design. A </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>hacker</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, 
        therefore, was someone who created and implemented things of this kind.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A hacker, generally speaking, is a person 
        who uses a computer for its own sake because it's fun. An author that 
        uses a word processor all day is not a hacker. Neither is a graphic designer, 
        inventory specialist, or computer instructor. Their professions simply 
        require them to use a computer to simplify or improve the efficiency of 
        some other task. However, a </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>programmer</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> that loves his or her work is a hacker. 
        Likewise, an enthusiastic computer technician or microcomputer designer 
        is also a hacker. Last but definitely not least, there are </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>hobby 
        hackers</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, who actually constitute 
        the largest and most overlooked group of computer enthusiasts - probably 
        because they don't use a computer in a professional sense. These amateurs 
        do not have PR directors shouting their cause, nor do they have publishers 
        or trade journals that print their opinions. Some elements of the media 
        focus on this group, but they seldom speak for them; rather, the computer 
        media generally focuses on &quot;bringing up&quot; the amateurs to the 
        standards and norms of the professionals.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the following section, I will try to 
        summarize a variety of concepts, names, and ideas, all relating to electronic 
        culture and especially the hacker culture. I will also attempt the rather 
        difficult task of classifying these events and ideas from a historical 
        perspective. This can be a risky venture, considering that the time frame 
        is short and it is the type of thing that often generates lots of criticism. 
        Nevertheless, I will proceed; I feel worthy of this task because I have 
        grown up in this culture, and I consider myself to have a very personal 
        relationship to it. I will even suggest that I have some of my information 
        generation's spirit in my blood. Furthermore, I </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>feel</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> that it needs to be done</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It is a tangled story primarily concerned 
        with young people in the 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90's. It is a history of 
        devotion, computer programs, authority and ingenious scientists. The tale 
        is about hippies, yippies, libertarians, anarchists and classical socialists 
        in one sordid mess, and the ideology that was born out of this mess through 
        a conglomerate of subcultures. We will be thrust between order and chaos, 
        from quiet computer rooms where the only the soft clicking of keyboards 
        can be heard, to high-octane decibels at techno-rave parties in European 
        warehouses.<br>
        </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let us travel to MIT, sometime in the 60's, 
        for it is where the story begins...<br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b><br>
        </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>The Cradle of the Hacker Culture</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><br>
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;It was no coincidence that 
        the hacker culture was born at MIT. This is where the first large computer 
        networks were created, and the faculty discovered that some of their students 
        were so devoted to their computer studies that the teachers let them work 
        independently. Among the more famous people at this liberal faculty we 
        find </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Marvin Minsky</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">, now a legendary scientist in the field 
        of artificial intelligence. Thus, the first hacker's association was born 
        out of a close-knit group of dedicated students. The work ethic that formed 
        among these early hackers resembled both that of academic study and that 
        of a non-profit organization.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A &quot;Hacker Club&quot; by itself was 
        hardly anything new; like other student groups, both bad and good things 
        came of the association. However, this club became more sectarian and 
        devoted (read: fanatic) as it grew. The mood of the group came to resemble 
        that of the groupof students in the movie </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>Dead 
        Poets' Society</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, and the members 
        increasingly neglected their studies in favor of the exploration of computers 
        and computer technology. In particular, Digital Equipment Corporation's 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>PDP-1 </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">computer 
        turned out to be incredibly addictive. This machine differed from the 
        mammoth IBM machines that had been used by universities since 1948, in 
        that you could work </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>directly</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> with the computer. You could see your program's 
        execution, and you could correct errors (debug) while the program was 
        running. In a flash, the hackers invented a number of new programming 
        tricks and developed, among other things, the first computer game </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><i>(Spacewar</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">) 
        and the first joystick. The accomplishments of these hackers became so 
        notable that they were asked to assist in the development of the </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><b>PDP-6</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> 
        computer, which became a huge hit for Digital. The company currently manufactures 
        behemoths like </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>VAX </b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">and </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>DEC 
        </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">computers, and it owes a great 
        deal of its success to the hackers at MIT.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If these hackers had been treated like other 
        students, they would have been expelled when it turned out that they spent 
        their days (and especially nights) hacking away on the school's computers 
        instead of studying for their finals. That would have been the end of 
        the story. However, by a stroke of luck, the American Department of Defense 
        developed an interest in MIT's resources through ARPA (Advanced Research 
        Projects Agency), which paid MIT to hire developers for a project named 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>MAC</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>.</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> MAC stood for Multiple Access Computing 
        and Machine Aided Cognition; the goals of these projects were to have 
        several users sharing a computer, and to make it simple for users to take 
        advantage of the computer's resources.<br>
        </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At MIT, the hackers progressed to developing 
        networks, message systems (one of the worlds first time-sharing systems, 
        which allowed users to share a computer by allowing it to process the 
        requests of one user at a time), and above all </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>artificial 
        intelligence</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"> (AI), a research 
        area in which MIT is still a world leader. The hackers speculated about 
        the nature of intelligence, and could not understand what made it so difficult 
        to capture even the simplest operation of intelligence within the circuits 
        of a processor. In the late 70's, a computer science professor by the 
        name of </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Douglas Hofstadter </b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">released a book with positively religious 
        undertones called </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>G&#246;del, 
        Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, 
        which has served as an articulated statement of the hackers' world view. 
        This work is well-known among hackers, and is also considered a masterpiece 
        by literary experts. Unfortunately, the book is </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>challenging 
        </i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">(but not hard to read), and it 
        is found in the mathematics section in most libraries, which tends to 
        scare off many potential readers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hackers derived a philosophical foundation 
        for their culture from Hofstadter, and speculations about self-referential 
        intelligent systems (self-referential means &quot;learning from mistakes&quot;, 
        or simply: learning ) figured heavily in this philosophy. Parallels were 
        drawn to such varied subjects as paradoxes among the ancient philosophers, 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Bach's </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">mathematical 
        play with harmonies, </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Escher's</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> mathematically inspired etchings and drawings, 
        and </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Benoit Mandelbrot</b></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman">'s theories of order within chaos (which 
        are physically illustrated by computer-generated chaos images, also known 
        as </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>fractals</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">). 
        The arguments in the book eventually lead to an understanding of G&#246;del's 
        Theorem, which proves that every complete mathematical system, by virtue 
        of its characteristics, contains errors - i.e., there must exist statements 
        that are true, but cannot be proven inside the system.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hofstadter's book culminates in an argument 
        regarding self-reference and artificial intelligence, which is designed 
        to describe human and machine intelligence as a function of mathematical 
        systems. As mentioned, MIT housed the pioneers in artificial intelligence, 
        and many of its hackers were convinced (and remain convinced) of the possibility 
        of building intelligent machines. However, it is sufficient to establish 
        that this early generation of hackers were very concerned with mathematics, 
        mathematical philosophy, and classical natural sciences. This MIT-born 
        philosophy, centered around intelligent systems, became the mainstay of 
        the hacker generation. It also became important for hackers to display 
        their own cultural identity. According to </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Sherry 
        Turkle</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, a Harvard sociologist 
        and the author of the book </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>The 
        Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, 
        the hackers that she has interviewed prefer listening to Bach in particular, 
        and avoid more romantic composers such as Beethoven because of a </font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"><i>lack of</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>order</i></font> 
        <font face="Times New Roman"> in these compositions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">That the hackers formed a tight core, with 
        their own esthetic and philosophical values, was also a result of their 
        voluntary seclusion. Among all university students, technology majors 
        tend to keep the most to themselves, and an overwhelming majority are 
        male. Among technology majors, computer science students are the most 
        reclusive, and they are even more disproportionately male. If you happen 
        to be a &quot;reject&quot; from the beginning, it is not hard to start 
        re-evaluating your view of society and your environment in general. If 
        you also happen to be Army buddies, this process is almost inevitable. 
        The hackers mostly associated with each other, preferably by computer. 
        In essence, they formed a government-sanctioned subculture.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The original hackers at MIT were, among 
        others, </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Alan Kotok, Stewart Nelson, 
        Richard Greenblatt, Tom Knight, </b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">and 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Bill Gosper</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">. 
        They were known to pull thirty-hour shifts in front of the computer and 
        then crash for twelve hours. They found the machines so fascinating that 
        they forgot about everything else while they were working. At the same 
        time, they nurtured an ideology that held that all information should 
        be free, ate Chinese take-out, and taught themselves how to pick every 
        lock in the computer science building - which they justified with their 
        devotion to putting all available equipment to its best use. Many considered 
        this behavior to be careless and disrespectful, but the hackers considered 
        it necessary to get the job done.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The fact is that the hackers constituted 
        a homogeneous group that should be the envy of any teacher: they were 
        interested in the subject of their studies, and they spent all day and 
        all night solving problems related to their field. The faculty did not 
        try to constrain them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At this time, the history of networks began. 
        Two computers were connected, then three, then many - and shortly, an 
        entire network was created. Communicating by computer removes a host of 
        irritating particulars present in real life: you don't have to dress up 
        while punching on a keyboard, you can be totally anonymous, nobody will 
        notice you belching or eating with your hands, and no one will know what 
        the color of your skin is. Another user forms his or her opinion of you 
        solely based on your written communication. Social status identifiers 
        are virtually erased, and your opinions are just as valid as anyone else's. 
        Nobody can beat you, fire you, or repress you if you decide to be insolent 
        or speak from your heart. People who communicate by computer tend to be 
        surprisingly honest and forthright, since the discussion is created by 
        everyone and anyone can participate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">MIT, Stanford, Berkeley, and other major 
        American universities were the pillars of the American defense project 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>ARPAnet</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman">, 
        which became the core of what is today known as the Internet. Through 
        this network, MIT hackers came into contact with hackers at other universities, 
        laying the groundwork for an national hacker culture which would later 
        spread to Europe and, in particular, Sweden. Many of the slang terms that 
        can be found in </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><i>The Jargon File 
        </i></font> <font face="Times New Roman">(a widely available file that 
        includes a dictionary of hacker terminology) stem from this period. Some 
        of the most venerable expressions can be traced to the original model 
        railroad club, TMRC. In addition to the dictionary, the file contains 
        anecdotes and observations on the nature of hacking, making it perhaps 
        the most important written work of the original hacker culture.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When hacker culture spread from MIT through 
        ARPAnet, it first reached the other large American universities that performed 
        computer research, including the prominent Stanford and Berkeley schools 
        on the other side of the continent. Thanks to ARPAnet, the hackers were 
        not hindered by geographic distances, and could cooperate and exchange 
        all kinds of information across this vast expanse - a privilege that normal 
        people would not enjoy until the 90's. In San Francisco during the late 
        60's and early 70's, hackers were influenced by hippie culture, and this 
        influence spread throughout the hacker communities of the entire world 
        through ARPAnet. This was the first interaction between the hacker community 
        and the hippie culture.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The hacker culture first reached Sweden 
        in 1973, when the Link&#246;ping School of Technology (LiTH) started specializing 
        in computer technology. The students formed a computer association called 
        </font> <font face="Times New Roman"><b>Lysator</b>, which still claims 
        to be the oldest computer club in Sweden (which is true), and the origin 
        of the true Swedish hacking tradition (which is more questionable). Lysator 
        will play a part in later sections of this book.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Hacker culture not only has its roots in 
        the academic realm; these university hackers only constitute a small part 
        of the digital culture scene. Now and then someone comes along and states 
        that only the hackers that attend college and basically live in the computer 
        labs are &quot;real&quot; hackers. Such a statement is ignorant and stupid. 
        The meaning of a word is, naturally, defined by its users, and anyone 
        who chooses to call him- or herself a hacker has the right to do so.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If we now allow the 60's to roll into the 
        70's, we will observe a monumental event: the introduction of the high-tech 
        amateurs, who were just as much hackers as Bill Gosper and his MIT buddies.</font></p>
