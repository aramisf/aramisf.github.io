      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Within computer culture</b>, and especially 
        hacker culture, women are rare. Among the phreakers, there were (and perhaps 
        still are) a few women, maybe because telephony is normally considered 
        a female profession. (most switchboard operators and such are women). 
        Rave culture is a little more equal, with about a third of the audience 
        being female. Among the hobby hackers and the criminal hackers, there's 
        only the occasional female enthusiast. Fortunately (I think), more and 
        more women, especially at the universities, have discovered computers 
        through the Internet. Often, someone starts out using the computer as 
        a typewriter, then she hears of online discussion groups and forums for 
        her major, and once she's tried communication over the Net, she's bitten.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The most famous female hacker went under 
        the pseudonym <b>Susan Thunder</b>. (Allow me to jump back and forth a 
        bit between the themes of the book). Susan was a textbook example of a 
        maladjusted girl. She'd been mistreated as a kid, but was of the survivor 
        kind. She became a prostitute as early as her teens, and earned her living 
        working LA brothels. On her time off, she was a groupie, fraternizing 
        with various rock bands. She discovered how easy it was to get backstage 
        passes for concerts just by calling up the right people and pretending 
        to be, for example, a secretary at a record company. She became an active 
        phreaker at the very end of the 70's, and was naturally an expert at social 
        engineering.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Soon, she hooked up with a couple of guys 
        named <b>Ron</b> and <b>Kevin Mitnick</b>, both notorious hackers, later 
        to be arrested for breaking into the computers of various large corporations. 
        Susan's specialty was attacking military computer systems, which gave 
        her a sense of power. To reach her objectives, she could employ methods 
        that would be unthinkable for male hackers: she sought out various military 
        personnel and went to bed with them. Later, while they were sleeping, 
        she could go through their clothes for usernames and passwords. (Many 
        people kept these written down on pieces of paper in order to remember 
        them). Susan therefore hacked so that she could feel a sense of <i>power 
        </i>or <i>influence </i>in this world, despite her hopeless social predicament. 
        For her, hacking was a way to increase her self-esteem.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">She was determined to learn the art of hacking 
        down to the finest details. When her hacker friend, Ron, didn't take her 
        completely seriously, she became angry and did everything she could to 
        get him busted. Another reason for her anger was, supposedly, that she 
        had had short relationship with him but he had chosen another, more socially 
        acceptable girlfriend over her. It was probably Susan who broke into U.S. 
        Leasing's systems and deleted all the information off one computer, filling 
        it with messages such as &quot;FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU&quot;, and programming 
        the printers to continuously spit out similar insults. Among all the profanities, 
        she wrote the names Kevin and Ron. The incident led to the first conviction 
        of the legendary Kevin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When Ron and Kevin were arrested, Susan 
        was given immunity from prosecution in return for witnessing against them. 
        Later, she referred to herself as a security expert, and conspicuously 
        demonstrated how easily she could break into military computers. It is 
        beyond all doubt that Susan really <i>had</i> enormous capabilities, and 
        that she really <i>could</i> access top-secret information in military 
        systems. It is less certain that she could fire nuclear missiles. It is 
        clear that she couldn't do it using only a computer. Possibly, with her 
        access to secret phone numbers, personal information, and security codes, 
        she <i>might</i> have been able to trick the personnel at a silo into 
        firing a missile. I really hope that she couldn't. Stories about hackers 
        like Susan provided the basic idea for the movie <i>War Games</i>. Susan 
        has currently abandoned hacking in favor of professional poker playing, 
        which she engages in with great success.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, Susan is more of the exception 
        that confirms the rule when it comes to hacking as a male endeavor. This 
        phenomenon has lots of candidate explanations, ranging from moronic propositions 
        that computers are unfeminine because they were invented by men (like 
        the sowing machine, the coffee maker, and the telephone), to suggestions 
        that women are somehow alien to the internal competition for status and 
        arrogance that characterizes hackers. All of this is naturally bullshit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The real reason to the inequality within 
        the computing world is <i>probably</i> that many women are raised to fulfill 
        passive roles. While men learn to passionately engage themselves in discussion 
        over, for example, things on the TV screen, women learn to passively observe 
        and act as social complements on the sidelines. Passion, assertiveness, 
        and arrogance, all typical characteristics of hackers, are seldom encouraged. 
        <i>Women are taught a superficially passive demeanor, in which their only 
        possibility for action is by entrusting it to the hands of men</i>. All 
        exploration of new territory apparently has to be done by men. (Preferably 
        <i>young</i> men). As an example, look at our traditional way of handling 
        emotional and sexual relations, where the general trend is still that 
        men take the initiative and women should provide the passive, nurturing 
        factor. Another factor is that men are more solitary than women. It's 
        an open subject as to why this is, but it is obvious that it is incredibly 
        difficult to break this pattern.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Since hackers are normally of an age in 
        which it is very important to externally display one's gender identity, 
        many women distance themselves from computers out of fear of seeming &quot;unfeminine&quot;. 
        This act, which is perceived as an autonomous decision by the individual, 
        is actually part of the social indoctrination of traditional gender roles. 
        Parents and relatives add to this by giving computers almost exclusively 
        to boys, and almost never to girls.&nbsp;Among the home computer hackers 
        during the period of 1980-89, about 0.3 % were female, according to rough 
        estimates. In the U.S., there was a female Apple II cracker who managed 
        to liberate around 800 games from their copy protection. In Europe, the 
        most famous female hackers were part of the <b>TBB</b> (The Beautiful 
        Blondes) group, which specialized in C64 and consisted of four women under 
        the pseudonyms of <b>BBR, BBL, BBD,<i> </i></b>and <b>TBB</b>, of which 
        BBR and TBB were programmers. They became known on the Scene through a 
        number of demos toward the end of the 80's. Cynically enough, both BBR 
        and TBB died in 1993, not even reaching the age of 20. Among today's Amiga 
        and PC enthusiasts, the proportion of women is a little higher, somewhere 
        around 1% (Source: <b>The Mistress</b> in <i>Skyhigh &quot;17</i>, 1995).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">At MIT, the cradle of hacker culture, there 
        weren't any women at all. There were female programmers who used the machines, 
        and even really good ones, but they never developed the obsession found 
        among the young men at MIT. These hackers thought it had to be a matter 
        of genetic differences that caused the women to not fall into this obsession. 
        This is a dangerous opinion and absolutely untrue.&nbsp;According to statistics, 
        most boys who become intensively engaged in computing are around 14-15 
        years old. The same preoccupation occurs in women too, but usually about 
        two years earlier, since their biological clock dictates it. Most people 
        know what 12-year-old girls can get caught up in with such intense interest 
        that they forget social duties and just concern themselves with the <i>hobby</i> 
        for its own sake.&nbsp;The women's (or, rather, the girls') equivalent 
        of the rather fickle but enchanting object known as the computer, is another 
        object with similar characteristics - a four-legged one, which we usually 
        call a <i>horse</i>. In many cases the similarities are striking, even 
        though it is difficult to prove that the same mechanisms lie behind it. 
        Programming a computer is really not that different from teaching a horse 
        to jump fences. It includes the same measure of competition, control, 
        and ceremony. With the boys in front of the computer, there's an almost 
        empathic passion, just like it is with the girls in the stables.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">It's completely obvious that if this trend 
        continues, men will acquire the power in a future society largely built 
        on computer technology. It would be a good thing if more women used computers. 
        Even hackers are generally positively of a positive attitude towards seeing 
        more women in their male-dominated fields. The few women that exist on 
        the Scene have been very successful, and received lots of attention as 
        &quot;exotic&quot; phenomena. The respect for female hackers is very great. 
        Supposedly, there are also female hackers who have hidden their gender 
        and are assumed to be male by their hacker friends. The thrill of playing 
        out such a role isn't hard to understand. For the first time in history, 
        it's been possible to assume a gender opposite of one's own without great 
        difficulty, and for a woman to really be treated like a man.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The German police sometimes use this respect 
        for female hackers to bust hackers and software pirates. By publishing 
        posts and ads on BBSs and in computer magazines, using female names, they 
        attract the attention of their targets. It is a matter of argument whether 
        it's ethically correct to exploit people's emotions in this manner in 
        order to fight crime, and it obviously does no service to equality. It 
        becomes even more difficult for women to break into a sub-culture where 
        they might be suspected of being law enforcement moles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>Pornography, etc.</b><br>
        One cannot fail to note the preponderance of male chauvinism on the Internet 
        and in the home-computing world. Basically, it all started with the game 
        <i>Softporn</i> for the Apple II, by the <b>Sierra On-Line</b> computer 
        company, and the even more successful sequel for the IBM PC: <i>Leisure 
        Suit Larry</i>. The object of the two games is the same: getting women 
        into bed. The fact that the Internet is crawling with soft- and hardcore 
        pornography doesn't help things either. Whether or not this is a sign 
        of a screaming need for sexual stimulation among male computer users is 
        hard to say. (In any case, there's no shortage of pictures of naked men). 
        Naturally, it's less embarrassing to download pictures to your computer 
        than going out and buying porn mags - since no one can see what you're 
        doing. (As far as you know, at least).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A large part of the pictures available on 
        the Internet are marketing tools for different pay-BBSs, from which you 
        can retrieve even more pictures - if you pay&#133; As usual there is, 
        in the porn industry, a ruthless commercial interest in the Internet. 
        Sex sells, and the Net is used as bait in a new and lucrative market. 
        I'm going to emphasize that this is mostly a trend in the U.S. I have 
        yet to hear of a Swedish BBS that works this way - instead, in Sweden 
        it's free to download the pictures, which the users engage in with abandon. 
        A few porn magazines have opened their own Internet zones which users 
        have to pay to gain access to.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Some PC enthusiasts have gotten a bug for 
        collecting porn pictures, and collect them in the same manner as others 
        collect stamps or trading cards. Actually, this hobby isn't anything strange. 
        During the early years of hacking, many collected thousands of computer 
        games just to have them. It was <i>forbidden</i>, since the manufacturers 
        claimed that copying the games was prohibited. Pornography is <i>both</i> 
        taboo and copyright-protected, since they are almost always scanned from 
        porn magazines. It should be added that the porn industry is less than 
        pleased with this type of distribution.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Censoring these pictures on the network 
        is virtually impossible, and not necessarily desirable. The Internet is 
        based on the supposition that you search for the information that you're 
        interested in, and that you thereby bypass information that you find irrelevant, 
        and this is the philosophy that colors the attitude of those who maintain 
        the network. Whoever publishes the information holds the responsibility, 
        and the middleman cannot be blamed for anything. It would be just as consistent 
        to accuse Telia or the postal service of being accessories in crime for 
        not conducting enough surveillance and letter-scanning. Communication 
        should be free.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">SUNET (Swedish University NETwork), under 
        the command of Bj&#246;rn Eriksen, distributes the Internet in Sweden. 
        They have so far consistently refused to interfere with the flow of information. 
        (And I hope they never will). Individual universities, however, have (following 
        public awareness) started to block certain discussion groups with themes 
        such as piracy, sex, suicide, and drugs.&nbsp;Blocking pictures in general, 
        however, is much more tricky, not to say impossible. If someone encrypts 
        the pictures, it becomes <i>completely</i> impossible to stop them. The 
        only thing you can do is monitor the pictures stored on the computers 
        inside your own organization, which has led to public intervention against 
        pornography at the Lund and Ume&#229; universities, among others.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you really wanted to crush the market 
        for the porn industry, you could simply remove its entitlement to copyrights 
        for its products. This would immediately ruin the market for the established 
        industry, and force the companies to go bankrupt in just a couple of years.&nbsp;I 
        will, for the sake of clarity, add that most women who are actively involved 
        with BBSs and the Internet take the whole thing in good stride. If someone 
        insults them with profanities, they usually respond with the text version 
        of a pat on the head - <i>&quot;There, there, calm down now&quot;</i>, 
        or something similar.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Even if cyberspace is male-dominated, we 
        can comfort ourselves with the fact that the world's first programmer, 
        <b>George Byron</b>'s daughter <b>Ada Lovelace</b>, was a woman. Ada was 
        a <i>real</i> hacker, by the classic definition. She was the product of 
        a failed marriage between Byron and Annabella Milbanke. Just like many 
        contemporary hackers, she escaped painful emotions by dedicating herself 
        to the natural sciences together with her friend <b>Charles Babbage</b>, 
        and completely immersed herself in the quest to construct <i>the analytical 
        machine</i>.</font></p>
