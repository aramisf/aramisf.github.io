      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
        book's coming</font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> to 
        an end soon, and I should make some predictions of what we can expect 
        on the electronic front in the days to come. If you want a nightmarish 
        vision, then you could read my futuristic novel-in-progress called <i>Digitala 
        Dagar</i> (&quot;Digital Days&quot;)<sup><a href="#FTNT1">(1)</a></sup>, 
        but this is science fiction. However, the book is relevant to what follows 
        - which is my personal predictions, not pure fact. Everything I write 
        from this point on is speculation, and since the future is always in motion, 
        I might reconsider the points I'm about to put forth.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The electronic universe is 
        actually a new world, which we call cyberspace. It is a place where small 
        communities of information have been allowed to exist in the state of 
        a sort of loosely organized anarchy. Cyberspace is in the process of becoming 
        civilized as it grows. Within a decade or so, everyone in this country 
        will have access to the Internet and be part of the electronic community, 
        and just like all other communities it suffers from crime and internal 
        conflicts.At the same time, the human factor is always present. Cyberspace 
        is a place occupied by people, and wherever you find people, you find 
        politics and culture. As a tool, the computer is unbeatable; it can construct 
        and visualize with a unique precision. Electronic art is not a fad, but 
        something we will see more and more. The musicians and painters of the 
        future will leave traditional methods and migrate to virtual reality and 
        instruments that don't exist as of yet. Motor skills and rhythm won't 
        be required to make music. The ability to mix colors and execute pen strokes 
        won't be required to make art. The only prerequisites will be imagination 
        and the ability to use technology - which becomes easier and easier to 
        use. Artists who only work with artificial worlds, <i>spacemakers</i>, 
        will basically be able to act as <i>gods</i> in the artificial realities 
        - for better and worse. (Nietzsche's statement that God is dead is frighteningly 
        tangible in a virtual reality). Perhaps professional artists will go away 
        in favor of a large number of amateurs following the introduction of advanced 
        technology into the mainstream.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In early computer art, such 
        as demos, the computer was used like a musical instrument. Just as a guitarist 
        finds hidden attributes in his or her instrument when he/she finds out 
        it's possible to play <i>flageolets</i>, or notes affected by the physical 
        characteristics of the string, early computer artists found hidden potential 
        in their machines. This was particularly the case with the C64 and Atari 
        ST. Modern computer art is more a matter of constraint - in virtual reality, 
        <i>everything</i> is possible: it's the nightmare of the canvas. It's 
        easy to overdo it and become totally incoherent. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Like I said before, the digital 
        universe is just a mirror image of the &quot;real&quot; one. The only 
        thing that's really <i>strange</i> about cyberspace is the sudden <i>proximity</i> 
        of information and other people, and the breathtaking boost in cultural 
        and social evolution that this proximity causes. We hate it for its distorted 
        image of ourselves, reflected as if by a twisted mirror. The behavior 
        patterns of people are ever so obvious within the framework of a computer. 
        Soon, our society will be so interlinked and complex that it will become 
        as dependent on computers as our bodies are on a circulatory system. There 
        is (unfortunately?) absolutely no return. Not even now, today, can we 
        turn back. Our last chance to guide society away from computerization 
        came and went with the 50's. It's not a question of computers or not - 
        it's a question of how to use them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The new communication channels 
        will fundamentally change the way public opinion is formed. There will 
        be more responsibility on the part of the individual for sorting information. 
        If Swedish youth would suddenly start showing a great interest in certain 
        suspect publications, many people would probably react strongly to this. 
        There would be a public debate of the publications' agenda and opinions.We 
        have no control over electronic publication. No one knows the distribution 
        size, how many copies exist, and when a reader has viewed the paper, it's 
        erased from the computer's memory, leaving nothing - except new ideas, 
        thoughts, and opinions in the brain of the reader. The only way to find 
        out what a person reads electronically, is by monitoring him or her at 
        all times. The responsibility for forming public opinion will wholly or 
        partially shift <i>from</i> society and established media to the individual. 
        Media will have a hard time keeping track of all the interest groups that 
        will arise. All people will be forced to think on their own, whether they 
        want to or not.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The possibility of having 
        an opinion without having to stand up for it is considerable. If political 
        discussions to a greater extent are held electronically, on the Internet 
        and on BBSs, it becomes virtually <i>impossible</i> to resort to personal 
        attacks on people with different views, since every modern conferencing 
        system contains the often-used option of remaining anonymous (under a 
        pseudonym). The rhetoric of public debate will certainly also change in 
        accordance with Rule #3: <i>distrust authority.</i> By extension: distrust 
        the entire social hierarchy. Power <i>always</i> corrupts; the fourth 
        state - the media - is no exception.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The chronicling of history 
        won't be as geographically centered as before. It won't be possible to 
        say that <i>&quot;this idea emerged in Chicago, USA, around 1997&quot;</i>. 
        Maybe not even what people were involved. Ideas and social perspectives 
        will spread globally almost instantly. Opinions, ideologies, and innovations 
        of all kinds will be created in the discussion groups on the networks, 
        and they'll be created on a global level and by people from totally different 
        walks of life. Some will be CEOs, some will be thieves, some 70 years 
        old and some 14. The most important thing will be the ability to articulate 
        oneself. No one cares what you look like, where you're from, or how you 
        dress. Perhaps there will be a distinction between ideas that have originated 
        in cyberspace and those that haven't. Debates will be held between those 
        who are interested and seek out the discussion by themselves, not by &quot;pundits&quot;. 
        The distance between debaters will become <i>purely</i> intellectual.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Social self-censorship (which 
        means that, for example, publications which defend the use of drugs don't 
        get press subsidies and are consistently resisted) doesn't exist on the 
        networks. Instead, it's up to the individual to decide what's right and 
        wrong. Instead of hiding behind an editor-in-chief, you have to stand 
        for what you write. This tendency is notable in the daily press, where 
        it's become more of a rule to sign articles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Putting an interactive terminal 
        in the hands of a normal person means considerable change. At first, it's 
        not terribly exciting. You discover the Internet through the World Wide 
        Web, which isn't much more captivating than a library or a TV program. 
        It is one-way information for the individual, and not very interactive. 
        Today, the big companies and institutions largely control the World Wide 
        Web, even though there are brilliant exceptions. It's not too surprising 
        that the small amount of material that isn't commercial has been produced 
        either by public institutions or hackers. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But then, you hopefully discover 
        Usenet, where you can <i>discuss</i> anything between heaven and Earth 
        without being spoon-fed ready-made solutions by experts. You might discover 
        IRC, where you can hold real-time conversations with other people from 
        anywhere in the world. And then you discover that you have many equals, 
        and even that you're an expert on many things, and that your own knowledge 
        is valuable. Then, things start to happen in the homes around the country. 
        Swedes are transformed from passive consumers to interactive world citizens, 
        and this is the real digital revolution. If no <i>market forces</i> (Telia, 
        Microsoft, etc.) succeed in stopping, commercializing, or obscuring it 
        before it has a chance to grow&#133;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It's the case that this planet 
        we inhabit, Spaceship Earth, is starting to become so internationalized 
        that all the people aboard are starting to develop certain common values. 
        It's a rough, uphill ride, but it's happening everywhere. Information 
        technology, especially the two-way kind, will be the decidedly most important 
        link in a society that can stand united in Sweden and Australia as well 
        as in Japan and on Madagascar. This demands communication free from monopoly, 
        and freedom of information. I am convinced that we will find a compromise.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A few years ago, many politicians 
        and sci-fi authors cautioned us about the risk that information technology 
        would be used to control people <i>everywhere</i>. (The examples used 
        included <b>Ira Levin's</b> <i>One Fine Day,</i> <b>Karin Boyes'</b><i> 
        Kallocain</i>, and <b>George Orwell's</b> <i>1984</i>.) This is what organizations 
        like the EFF want to stop at all costs. The encryption program PGP was 
        created <i>just for this purpose</i>, and this gift should be considered 
        a social good deed. The encryption expert, Zimmerman, is maybe deserving 
        of the Nobel Peace Prize for his service to the protection of &quot;healthy 
        disobedience&quot;.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When I was younger, I had 
        a diary with a small lock on it. Many adults have one too. Now I don't 
        need to lock my computer, because encryption is enough. It's in any case 
        much more effective than physical locks for protecting information.&nbsp;The 
        problem is that criminal investigators, for example, may very well consider 
        my diary part of the investigation material. I don't think so. My thoughts 
        belong only to me, and I'm not going to abandon them to anyone. The desire 
        to read other people's diaries is, in my view, just a step on the way 
        to the desire to read other people's thoughts. Diaries are an improvement 
        of one's memory, an extension of the intellect. Where is the person? In 
        the body, or in the diary, or both? Some diary-keeping people discover 
        details of their past that their brains have forgotten&#133; <i>&quot;My 
        actions occur in my body, but parts of my mind are on the bookshelf&quot;</i>. 
        Yes, we're information-processing individuals, all right. And information 
        technology is so many times better than a library ever was at storing 
        and processing information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you want to write anything 
        hidden from the mafia, the government, or your family, you should use 
        encryption. The possibility to erect a &quot;firewall&quot; against the 
        oversight of authorities is vital to any democracy. PGP, in one swoop, 
        puts humanity's collected mathematical science between you and the superior 
        powers. Zimmerman's crypto also allows you to set up &quot;bug-free&quot; 
        communication channels.<sup><a href="#FTNT2">(2) </a></sup>Encryption 
        is a fact, and I suggest that anyone who wants a bit of personal freedom 
        and privacy use it. I'm not going to deny that well-applied encryption 
        will make it impossible to stop nazi propaganda, child pornography, violent 
        movies, and that it can partially protect criminal syndicates. I'm split 
        on this issue, but I ultimately think that it's worth the price to protect 
        the private lives of individuals from governmental, corporate, and organizational 
        control. Furthermore, there's already crypto around the homes of the country. 
        As for me, I got my copy of PGP on a CD supplied with the magazine Mikrodatorn 
        (a Swedish home computing magazine), and which can be found in any well-stocked 
        library. No authority in the world has the possibility to decrypt information 
        that's been encrypted, using today's technology. Prometheus has already 
        stolen fire from the gods, and no one can call it back.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I observe the changes in society 
        with excitement: encryption can perhaps end the <i>Pepto-bismol policies</i> 
        that, for example, in the case of child pornography, treat the symptoms 
        instead of the disease. For we all have to conclude that it's not pornography 
        <i>in itself</i> which is the problem, but rather that there is <i>demand</i> 
        for it. This, however, is a harder problem to address&#133;</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It wouldn't surprise me at 
        all if there was soon another debate about prohibition in our stuck-up 
        Swedish media. A debate such as the one in 1980, which started when Kulturarbetarnas 
        Socialdemokratiska F&#246;rening (the Social Democratic Association of 
        Culture Workers) wanted to prohibit TV satellite dishes in order to prevent 
        Swedish residents from watching unsuitable television programs. (Which, 
        in retrospect, looks pretty absurd). Of course - attack technology, there's 
        never anything wrong with people.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The debate will naturally 
        be caused by something that upsets the average family: drugs, pornography, 
        political or religious extremists. All of this is now available on the 
        Internet, mostly in the form of text or pictures. Tomorrow, it'll be there 
        in the form of sound and motion pictures. In the future, it might be some 
        form of virtual reality. The U.S. Congress has <i>tried</i> to prohibit 
        effective crypto, and the European Union has issued directives banning 
        un-crackable encryption. Naturally, nothing will come of either one, at 
        least nothing that will be respected any more than the prohibition of, 
        say, jaywalking. Human nature includes an ability to resist every form 
        of thought control. (Or should we call it information control?)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If people have any sense (and 
        they do), they'll realize that we're dealing with international problems. 
        Mom and apple pie are disintegrating, and the problems of the world are 
        approaching from every direction. At some point, perhaps we'll realize 
        the need of <i>even more</i> international cooperation, and of course 
        it's just as difficult to keep international problems outside the EU as 
        it is to keep them out of Sweden. The information society grows towards 
        internationalization by its own force. All of this thanks to some hackers 
        who created ARPAnet, later to become Internet, and which interconnected 
        the whole world, for better or for worse. The change has just begun. It 
        is without doubt the most beautiful, magnificent <i>hack</i> ever executed. 
        The university hackers hacked down barriers between educational institutes, 
        then between countries, economic interests - and yes, between <i>people</i>. 
        Maybe I'm being a bit dramatic, but you know what I mean.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Rave culture and electronic 
        pop music aren't fads - we'll get more and more of them, more genres, 
        and we'll educate professional musicians who've never played anything 
        but techno music, even at public institutions. The joy and vitality of 
        rave culture's futuristic shows yields optimism and a belief in the future. 
        With luck, rave culture will become for today's youth what 60's rock was 
        for the baby-boomers; a symbol of rebellion, identity, and creative thinking. 
        And in contrast to dystopic cyberpunk and many other modern trends, it 
        is <i>happy and optimistic</i>, not regressive or doomsaying. The same 
        goes for many other forms of electronic culture, including electronic 
        film as well as multimedia and online culture.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The most prominent danger 
        to democracy in conjunction with new technology is the risk that not <i>everyone</i> 
        will have access to it. In the US, almost every well-to-do middle-class 
        family has a computer, and even a modem. In the ghettos and industrial 
        suburbs, it's a pipedream. In Sweden, where the gap between classes is 
        not as wide as in the States, there's a marked risk that the gap will 
        <i>increase</i> if not <i>everyone</i> has access to computer technology. 
        If not, information will be available only to those who can afford it. 
        Remember the second rule of hacker ethics: <i>All information should be 
        free</i>. Internet and public computers at all the schools and libraries 
        around the country, even grade schools and community colleges, is a given. 
        A computer for each student is desirable. State subsidies for computer 
        equipment is a valid issue.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">I'm fully aware that I express 
        political opinions now, and I'm placing myself squarely against those 
        who think that technology, high-level jobs, etc. should be reserved for 
        the elite. Neither do I look up to hackers that are just out to show off 
        and don't care about anyone else. Following political and economic democracy, 
        we're now approaching a democracy of information. Information for the 
        people, perhaps. It's my hope that information technology will provide 
        the foundation for a more democratic society than we have today.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">You should think before judging 
        a hacker. A hacker is generally a middle-class youth who have acquired 
        possibilities that normally only the richest upper-class kids can revel 
        in, using computer technology. They've done this simply by going out there 
        and grabbing everything possible. Isn't this really what our whole modern, 
        class-based society's rules of the game are all about - that the privileged 
        should be able to pick and choose, but the less privileged get long sentences 
        if they try to get some of the goodies?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To categorically state that 
        hackers, phreakers, virus makers, or crackers are public enemies is bullshit. 
        It's simply pointing to superficial factors and appealing to authority. 
        Saying that a phreaker, taking some phone time in a fiber cable to talk 
        to his buddies in the States, is a thief because the law says so, is placing 
        100% trust in the makers of the law. It's reducing the problem to legal 
        text. It's a senseless oversimplification. Every law is constantly in 
        motion - that's how it actually works. You're one of the people that are 
        obligated to change the law if you realize that it is wrong. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Isn't the real crime of the 
        hacker that of challenging values and power structures that seek to distribute 
        influence and property unequally? For his or her own gain in the beginning, 
        certainly, but still. The true crime of the hacker is perhaps that he 
        or she has &quot;cracked&quot; <i>human software</i>, the social protocol 
        that's been programmed into out minds since birth.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And the university hackers 
        - without them, we wouldn't have <i>any</i> of the computer technology 
        we have today. All new ideas of any worth have emerged at MIT, Stanford, 
        or Berkeley, by kids who've worked passionately for minimal pay and under 
        uncertain employment terms. And most of them haven't earned a dime of 
        profit from their inventions. Instead, IBM, Microsoft, and the other giants 
        have raked in the profits. And the hackers are not at all upset! They 
        think that technology - information - should belong to everyone. They 
        never had any commercial interests. They thought it was <i>fun!</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the pinball games at the 
        autonomous rave and anarchist club<b> Wapiti</b> in Lund, Sweden, the 
        text OBEY AUTHORITY is sarcastically displayed on the kitschy LED screens. 
        Man has assumed control of the machine.</font> </p>
