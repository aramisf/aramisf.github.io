    <td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>On September 2, 1992, 25-year 
      old Otto Sync (ficticious name) was arrested and charged with unauthorized 
      use of the Datapak computer network. The infractions had taken place during 
      November 1992, at the expense of Televerket. At the time, Televerket was 
      a state-owned company with a monopoly on telecommunications in Sweden. The 
      person who traced and ordered the arrest of Otto was Televerket's own &quot;white 
      knight&quot; Pege Gustafsson, a zealous 38-year old security expert climbing 
      the career ladder.</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From December 1991 to 
      February 1993, Otto was doing non-combat service in the French army, &quot;Volontaire 
      Service National en Enterprises&quot;, as an engineer working with PLC (computerized 
      process controllers) at a French telecommunications company in Flen, Sweden. 
      After having passed rigorous military tests, and with the help of a master's 
      degree in engineering with credits in applied mathematics and computer science, 
      he was offered the opportunity to perform his civil service in the French 
      company's Swedish branch.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Being a lonely young 
      Frenchman in Flen wasn't much fun; Otto tells us that the town was full 
      of political refugees and the public mood wasn't the best -- the Swedish 
      youths in Flen kept to themselves and saw him as yet another immigrant, 
      and none of the other immigrants were French, but rather Iraquis, Kurds, 
      Somalians and so forth. Additionally, Otto was unfamiliar with a small-town 
      environment, as he had come straight from Lyon -- &quot;Imagine my surprise 
      when I arrived there alone mid December 1991... I've only lived in big cities 
      before, and there is this place, without any bars, pubs or computer shops&quot;<sup><a href="#FTNT1">(1)</a></sup></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">. As a result Otto spent most 
      of his time alone in his apartment or in company office. &quot;Flen is so 
      boring I practically lived in the office building -- what else can you do 
      there apart from hacking really?&quot;, as he says.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For the above reasons, 
      Otto spent his time engaging in his favorite hobby: hacking. Otto was already 
      a skilled hacker when he arrived in Flen, and as time passed he became even 
      better. He became a regular at Swedens best hacker-BBS at the time: Synchron 
      City. He explored every system he could reach: Televerket's public phone 
      network, AT&amp;T, Internet, and so on. However, none of this is very exciting 
      to an experienced hacker in the long run: the phone network is very easy 
      to trick, and the Internet was mostly full of regular people. Real hackers 
      went for BBS:es on the X.25 network. As Otto wished to stay in touch with 
      his hacker friends, he wanted to access the biggest hacker conference system 
      at the time - </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>QSD</i></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">. QSD was only accessible through 
      the international X.25 network. In trying to access QSD, he made a fatal 
      mistake: exploring Televerket's Datapak network.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>X.25 and Datapak</b></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Datapak is a network 
      which is structurally reminiscent of the Internet -- a packet-switched network, 
      where the users share a few dedicated lines, and pay charges based on the 
      amount of data transmitted on those lines (i.e., per packet). In general, 
      it works in such a way that, using a modem, you call up Datapak through 
      a so-called </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>PAD</i></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> connected to a 020-number (Swedish 
      800-number), then dial a number to a computer permanently connected to Datapak. 
      All computers on the Datapak network have datapak numbers in the same way 
      that phones in the public network have phone numbers.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Of course you can also 
      connect straight through Datapak in case you can afford a permanent connection 
      for your computer, a method primarily used by large companies to connect 
      their computer systems. That way, two computers can be permanently connected 
      through Datapak (which would have been very expensive using regular modems) 
      and thus you only have to pay charges for the information actually transmitted. 
      Of course you can also connect through the computer network Datex, which 
      is used by (among other things) ATMs, and it works like any other phone 
      network, except that it's designed for computers.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Datapak is built around 
      the X.25 standard , which describes how computers in the network are to 
      &quot;talk&quot; to each other. Besides X.25, there are many other standards 
      on the network, such as X.28 and X.75</font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">, 
      but as X.25 is the most common standard, the kind of network that Datapak 
      belongs to is generally called an &quot;X.25 network&quot;. The international 
      X.25 network is thus made up of a number of interconnected computer networks, 
      e&nbsp;g Datapak, Tymnet (which also manufactured the equipment used in 
      the Swedish Datapak network), SPRINTnet, and so forth. Almost every big 
      phone company in the industrialized world has their own X.25 network.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The international X.25 
      network has been running since the mid- and late 80's, but the Swedish Datpak 
      network has never been very big. The reason for this is that X.25 was not 
      targeted by the consumer market; X.25 is, as opposed to the common telephone 
      networks, not designed for individuals. X.25 was from the beginning a network 
      for corporations. The large consumer market that was conquered by the academic 
      Internet system, which is based on multiple service providers and competition 
      (as opposed to the X.25 market, which consists of oligopolies and only a 
      few providers), is so fundamentally different that X.25 does not have a 
      chance in this respect. X.25 is today mainly used for establishing logical 
      links between private networks. X.25 is even used for some Internet links.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So, what Otto Sync didn't 
      know, or didn't think of, when he ordered his Datapak subscription, was 
      that Datapak was a small system in a small country, and that a person who 
      tried to manipulate it would immediately be detected by the monitoring systems. 
      The public phone network is quite safe to explore because of all the odd 
      and random calls people make to strange places. A few cases of manipulation 
      instantly disappear in the vast amount of calls, but </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Datapak</i></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> was the backyard of a few subscribers. 
      To enter the system was equal to walking around wearing emergency flashers 
      on your head -- your presence was not very discreet. When Otto began scanning 
      Datapak numbers, he finally drew Televerket's attention.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is worth mentioning 
      that Televerket had increased the monitoring of the Datapak network due 
      to an enormous attack by the British hacker group 8LGM (8-Legged Groovin' 
      Machine, a name taken from an 80's pop group) who had scanned 22,000 datapak 
      number entries and accessed 380 computers all over the country about two 
      years earlier.<sup><a href="#FTNT2">(2)</a></sup></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
      Otto describes them as &quot;a group of top-notch hackers who released 'exploits' 
      advisories between 1991 and 1994&quot;. (Exploits are ready-to-use scripts 
      that were used to get higher privileges, usually root-access, on Unix systems.) 
      A consequence of 8LGM's scans was that all activity on Datapak was now logged 
      and analyzed.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Otto didn't subscribe 
      to Datapak in order to use it -- as a matter of fact, he only subscribed 
      in order to access the technical documentation given to every subscriber, 
      so he could find out how the system worked. That way he learned that you 
      connected to Datapak by dialing 020-910037 and submit your network user 
      identity (NUI). After this you could call as much as you pleased using Datapak, 
      and be charged per sent/recieved information packet at the end of the month 
      . In the Datapak network the NUI is used for customer identification, as 
      opposed to the common phone network where you are identified by your own 
      wall socket and phone number.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">But the Datapak manual 
      from Televerket also contained some other interesting things, e.&nbsp;g. 
      this example from page 4:</font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To connect with a user 
      number, call 020-910037 using a modem. When the modem has answered, you 
      write three dots followed by carriage return: ...&lt;CR&gt; (CR = carriage 
      return, enter). Then write: N123456XYZ123-024037131270&lt;CR&gt;. N tells 
      the computer that user identity and password follow, 123456 is the user 
      number you got when you signed up for the subscription, XYZ123 is your secret 
      password, and the figures after the dash is the host computer adress. (i. 
      e., the computer you want to connect to.)<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Further on in the manual, 
      it illustrates how user 123456 changes password from BERTIL to CAESAR. User 
      identity (NUI) 123456 is clearly used as an example.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When Otto considered 
      different ways of accessing Datapak, he came up with the idea of writing 
      a so-called &quot;scanner&quot;, which would test different combinations 
      of usernames and passwords.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Scanning is a technique 
      originally developed for the public phone network, and works by systematically 
      calling every possible number in some order, e&nbsp;g 111111, 111112, 111113 
      and so forth until you get an answer. When a computer answers the call, 
      you make a note of the number and move on to the next. Afterwards you can 
      pick systems from this list of accessible computers and see if you can hack 
      them. Of course you don't do scanning by hand. Just like in the movie War 
      Games, you write a program to test all numbers one by one. Scanning in itself 
      is not illegal -- part of the point of having a telephone is that you have 
      the right to place as many calls as you like, to whomever you like.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Otto's scanner was a 
      bit different. It was not supposed to call any numbers, just scan for user 
      identities and passwords that granted access to the Datapak PAD. Usually 
      a X.25-PAD will only allow you three tries to enter username and password 
      before the line is disconnected, but Otto found out that by connecting to 
      the Datapak password-database you could try three passwords at a time without 
      having the line disconnected. Otto's scanner was a computer program that 
      could test three passwords at a time, get thrown out of the database (without 
      being disconnected from the PAD), reconnect to the database, test three 
      more passwords and so forth. To disconnect / reconnect the phone line would 
      take a lot of time and result in a slow scan, but with the scanner using 
      the password database it was lightning-fast!<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When Otto wrote his scanner 
      he needed some number to test the program. By pure chance he entered the 
      obviously stupid combination of user identity 123456 and password 654321, 
      and it worked! (Does anybody besides me come to think of the movie &quot;Spaceballs&quot;? 
      -- only an idiot would use that code on his suitcase.)<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">User identity 123456 
      was one of Televerkets own lines, a test line which purpose is yet unknown. 
      It is perfectly possible that user 123456 was simply &quot;left over&quot; 
      by mistake by Televerket.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Otto began using identity 
      123456 for regular calls to the conference system QSD, which functionally 
      resembles the now very popular IRC, Internet Relay Chat. Apart from the 
      conferences there are also mailboxes for the users. Among the most frequent 
      participants were, for example, SCSI, who has hacked into every X.25 network 
      in the entire world (no overstatement), Sentinel from ex-Yugoslavia, the 
      female hacker Venix from Greece, Seven Up, the sysop at SECTEC (Sector Tectonics, 
      another X.25-bulletin board), and Raol from Italy -- the master of VAX-hacking 
      who was recently arrested for computer intrusion at the Bank of Italia.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This chatting kept going 
      until he, on the night of the 7th of November, was called (on the chat system 
      QSD) by another hacker from Sweden.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>The &quot;White Knight</b></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The hacker that called 
      Otto named himself White Night. The duality of the name is a conscious misspelling 
      of the kind that hackers love. The first conversation between Otto Sync 
      and White Night went thus:<sup><a href="#FTNT3">(3)</a></sup></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>White Night</b></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: Hi! Hej! [Hej is Swedish for 
      Hi]<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Otto Sync</b></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: Hi! Hej! Sorry I'm not Swedish 
      I'm French. Calling from Flen, a #$&amp;% city 120 km from Stockholm.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>WN</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      I see. What are you doing there?<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>OS</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      Working as an automation engineer at a French company. And you?<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>WN</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      I'm working at Volvo.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>OS</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      Where? I worked at their factory in Olofstr&#246;m some months ago.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>WN</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      DA-verken in G&#246;teborg. [Gothenburg]<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then they began talking 
      tecnicalities, as all hackers do. Otto asks White Night how he manages to 
      handle Swedish characters and they discuss the pros and cons of different 
      terminal programs. White Night then turns the discussion to how he has managed 
      to call QSD -- &quot;Do you know how much it costs?&quot;. Otto suggests 
      that they should swap &quot;outdials&quot; -- access codes to computers 
      on public access networks such as Internet, with connected modems allowing 
      you to dial out for free from that computer by accessing it's modem. He 
      also tells the stranger that he often calls Synchron City, and that a lot 
      of &quot;H/P/A&quot; (Hacking, Phreaking, Anarchy -- perfectly legal textfiles 
      describing hacking techniques) can be found there. Strangely, White Night 
      has never heard of Synchron City, and is immediately curious.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">For some weeks Otto calls 
      QSD on a regular basis. So on the night of November 29th, the white knight 
      appears again, but he doesn't recognize Otto, as Otto is using another alias 
      this time. Otto has already forgotten about White Night and doesn't recognize 
      him either when he is called. However he can see that White Night is also 
      using identity 123456, and gets a bit suspicious, as he has revealed that 
      identity only to a single other hacker, which we will call Phred. A bit 
      hesitatingly, he starts chatting with the stranger:<br>

      No, but I know him!<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>OS</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      I guess so... I know you?<br>

      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>WN</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      U speak Swedish?<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>OS</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      Very badly. But can't you tell me who u are??? As for me, I'm the one who 
      found the NUI you're using.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>WN</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">:

      You can ask Phred if you don't believe me.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>WN</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      Why should I ask Phred?<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>OS</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      Because he was the first one to whom I gave the NUI. We talk voice sometimes.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>WN</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      What NUI?<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>OS</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      The very obvious one with the very obvious password. And the second one 
      that I see on QSD.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>WN</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">: 
      Wow, I haven't spoken to Phred 4 a long time!<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The misunderstandings 
      between Otto Sync and White Night is of course due to the fact that White 
      Night is not a hacker. As a matter of fact, he is using Televerket's test 
      line, 123456, </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>from 
      inside</i></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Televerket. 
      When Otto claims that he found it, White Night first gets a bit sulky, but 
      then realizes he has to play the game:<br>

      Sweden what.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>OS</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">:

      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When Otto has made these 
      statements, White Night disconnects the line and picks up the papers with 
      the print-out of the conversation from the printer. These papers, most of 
      which contents are cited above, are then used as part of the evidence in 
      the trial against Otto Sync at the Katrineholm Court of Law.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What Otto didn't know 
      when this conversation took place, was that Televerket was busy tracing 
      him. From November 28th to December 1st, the day before the arrest, Televerket 
      registered all telephone traffic from Ottos office at the French telecom 
      company. In order to do this, they had taken some extraordinary measures.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Flen's telephone station 
      was at that time not equipped with the new electronic switching system AXE 
      (Automatic Cross-connection Equipment). Istead, an old electro-mechanical 
      exchange was in use. (It has now been replaced.) </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>If</i></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> the telephone station had been 
      equipped with AXE, the monitoring would have been a lot easier, since it 
      would simply have been a matter of requesting information from Televerket's 
      information system (IS), which can monitor a number automatically for unlimited 
      time. Present-day Telia (a private corporation which has replaced Televerket 
      after deregulation) even investigated the possibility of having computers 
      examine all calls automatically in order to classify which subscribers that 
      showed &quot;fraudulent patterns&quot; -- but these investigations didn't 
      bear fruit</font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When Televerket, under 
      the command of Pege Gustafsson, had traced the &quot;fraudulent&quot; calls 
      to the Datapak number 020-910037, they found that they came from a group 
      number belonging to the company Otto worked for. A group number works by 
      letting a company with an internal exchange connecting some number of telephones, 
      say 500, share a suitably large number of outgoing lines (perhaps 10--20 
      of them) so that they can minimize the subscription charges. By tracing 
      the group number, nothing was proven, as anyone at the company could have 
      called using the group number. The calls could not be tied to a physical 
      person, which is the kind of evidence required for this type of case.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To make further tracing 
      possible, Telverket installed a reader on the exchange of the company Otto 
      worked for<sup><a href="#FTNT4">(4)</a></sup></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">. 
      With the reader, every outgoing call from any extension at the company was 
      registered and printed. This list could then be compared by corresponding 
      list for connections to the Datapak PAD at 020-910037. In this manner, Televerket's 
      technicians found that Otto had called for 41 hours and 20 minutes through 
      Datapak during the week the tracing was carried out, and during that time 
      transmitted information packets for about 4000 Swedish crowns' worth [roughly 
      $570]. (You can call this the total &quot;postage fee&quot; for the information 
      packets.) The low cost thus depended upon the fact that you only pay for 
      the data actually transmitted, not for online time, as in the case of common 
      telephone calls.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">All of this tracing was 
      supervised by Pege Gustafsson.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>A Night at the Hotel</b></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Otto himself tells us 
      what happened on the morning of December 2:<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;They came to arrest 
      me at work. Imagine the embarrassement. First I see these guys coming in 
      my room and think 'oh shit, some more customers who want a demo on some 
      product', but then they showed me their police ID and my heart stopped. 
      They searched my office, took all notes and computer stuff. Then they took 
      me out and had me open my apartment, and did a search there as well.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">He was then brought to 
      Katrineholm police station (the police authority closest to Flen) for interrogation. 
      On his way there all sorts of thoughts ran through his head: &quot;What 
      to tell? I thought it was a BBS? I thought it was a free line? Reverse-charging?&quot;<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The interrogation begins 
      without the representatives of Televerket as well as Otto's counsel present, 
      but as Otto doesn't understand all the Swedish words (though he knew some, 
      as the company sent him to evening Swedish language classes), the interrogation 
      is postponed until a French interpreter arrives.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When the interpreter 
      arrives, Otto asks for a counsel but agrees to continue the interrogation 
      without the defense present. Neither does he find it necessary to talk to 
      the French embassy. He tells the interrogators that he is in non-combat 
      military service duty at the company in Flen, and that he has considered 
      working for them even after the service is finished. The police and Otto 
      simply get to know each other.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At 14.25 Otto experiences 
      the luckiest moment of his life so far. That is when his counsel arrives, 
      and who by a remarkable coincidence happens to be an extremely professional 
      lawyer with his own firm, who thought the hacker case looked interesting 
      at first glance, and thus took upon himself to defend Otto. This lawyer 
      primarily deals in industrial corporate disputes. Otto tells us about his 
      lawyer that &quot;he was a real pro (I know, as this was the third time 
      I went to court), a very nice man, well educated, and interested in French 
      wines&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The remainder of the 
      interrogation session mostly consists of technical discussions between Pege 
      and Otto Sync. The other people present soon have trouble understanding 
      what is being said. Otto claims that he has been searching for a &quot;reverse 
      charge&quot; number (the X.25 counterpart to a 800-number which are actually 
      quite common) and that he thought NUI 123456 that he got from Televerket's 
      manual to be a &quot;test line&quot; of some kind. He says he is very curious 
      and that is his reason for exploring Televerket's systems. Pege Gustafsson 
      produces his printouts from the chat sessions where he acts as White Night, 
      and confronts Otto with parts of these printouts (the same that are partly 
      reproduced above). Otto, who for the first time gets to know who White Night 
      actually is, reminds the others that anyone can have used his alias on QSD. 
      Pege asks if he has passed around the NUI 123456 to others. &quot;No&quot;, 
      he answers.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Today Otto tells us that 
      &quot;Pege tried to have me say that I knew what I was doing and that I 
      hacked the NUI etc. All the way I denied it and said I thought it was public 
      line to be used in reverse-charging mode, and kept that line all the way. 
      Of course Pege could see it was bullshit, he knew pretty well what I was 
      up to. And he was right.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When the interrogation 
      ended at 6 p.m. he was brought to a cell, as it was too late to go to court 
      that day. Otto was instantly impressed by the Swedish custody standard: 
      &quot;In France it's dirty, you get to sleep with drunkards, no food, rough 
      treatment etc. In Katrineholm it was like being at a hotel, I had my own 
      little bed in a neat room. In the morning I was given a breakfast as good 
      as the ones you get on planes -- fantastic! Slept really well there.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The next day he was brought 
      to Katrineholm court, which decided not to keep him in custody. Instead 
      he was given a travel ban, which meant he had to leave his passport and 
      had to report to the Flen police office before noon every day until the 
      start of the trial.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>&quot;Dangerous International 
      Terrorist&quot;</b></font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What initiated the chain 
      of events that culminated in Televerket finding Otto Sync was the scanning 
      of the Datapak PAD. When Pege found out that someone was scanning the Datapak 
      PAD for user identities, he must have been shocked. This was exactly the 
      thing that had happened two years earlier, and that time they had suspected 
      that this was an act of international terrorism. In reality it proved to 
      be the brothers Pad and Gandalf from 8LGM, two perfectly normal, curious 
      hackers without any connection to international terrorists whatsoever.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As all other computer 
      security officials in Sweden, Pege Gustafsson had read the book </font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>The Cuckoo's Egg</i></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> by Clifford Stoll. In the book 
      Stoll describes how he, using imagination and endless nights of unpaid work, 
      managed to trace a hacker that had entered his system at Berkeley and started 
      searching for military secrets throughout the American part of Internet. 
      The hacker doing this was on mission from the KGB, receiving instructions 
      through the circle around hackers like Pengo and Hagbard in West Berlin 
      -- a bunch of freaked-out, coke-snorting, fuzzy leftist hackers who probably 
      never caused any serious harm. Those last facts are never mentioned in the 
      book, but it is closer to the truth than the image of international computer 
      spies that Stoll conjures up.</font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So as Otto started scanning 
      the Swedish Datapak network, Pege hit the sirens. The incident was probably 
      associated with other, similar incidents, and was therefore interpreted 
      not as the sum total of some small hacking adventures using simple scanners, 
      but as a systematic pattern of intrusion attempts by some foreign power. 
      Simply pure paranoia.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After closing a ring 
      round Otto in Flen and after conducting a series of tracings, there was 
      also &quot;confirmation&quot; of the suspicions: Otto made several calls 
      to Thailand -- which were interpreted as communications with his mission 
      providers, which could be anyone ranging from the KGB to the IRA. Actually, 
      these calls were made to a long-time friend, and he had the company's permission 
      in calling Thailand every now and then. Every hacker gets to know lots of 
      people around the planet, as the &quot;global village&quot; is their home 
      district.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So what the police and 
      Televerket expected to find, as they turned up at Otto's office on the 2nd 
      of December 1992, was a dangerous international terrorist. They found a 
      25-year-old socially maladjusted, and bored engineer, who had been amusing 
      himself by exploring the Swedish Datapak network for the lack of anything 
      better to do. Otto describes the situation as \&quot;Pege thought he was 
      the good guy trying to catch the bad guy. He told me himself that he was 
      a fan of Clifford Stoll and that he met him at some security conference 
      some years ago.&quot; During the interrogation with Otto, Pege drew maps 
      showing which countries Otto's X.25-connections had accessed -- maps that 
      according to Otto himself looked like &quot;maps from your average international 
      terrorist handbook&quot;.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even though this was 
      clearly stated in the following investigation -- which didn't even mention 
      the suspicion of espionage -- these suspicions about Otto stuck to him long 
      after he left Sweden. When the computer programs that were to control starting 
      lists, time measures and result lists during the Olympic Games in Lillehammer 
      1994 were stolen from a military storage in the autumn of 1993, the Norweigan 
      police (for some reason) believed that Otto was involved. Expressen (a major 
      Swedish evening paper) called him &quot;the hacker leader&quot;, and took 
      the opportunity to draw suspicions to Otto as well as to the company he 
      had worked for in Flen. In between the lines, they hinted that this was 
      a way in which the French military sent spies to Sweden<sup><a href="#FTNT5">(5)</a></sup></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">. Personally, he tells us that 
      &quot;I was in Thailand, and at that time didn't have job nor a computer.&quot; 
      Thailand is quite far away from Lillehammer.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">He is also backed up 
      by S&#196;PO (Swedish counter-espionage) who through director J&#246;rgen 
      Almblad said that the French volunteer workers in Sweden in general, and 
      Otto Sync in particular, did not pose a security risk. &quot;If they are 
      Frenchmen or Russians doesn't matter, as far as being security risks&quot; 
      he told Expressen. S&#196;PO are ultimately responsible for the national 
      security and should be well-informed. If they publicly deny any suspicions, 
      you can be certain that they are telling the truth. If they had even the 
      slightest suspicions, they would rather not comment. So much for that terrorist.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even Pege himself realized 
      that Otto was not what he first thought him to be. In private he told Otto, 
      that if he had known what a small-timer he actually was, he wouldn't have 
      carried the case this far. He even &quot;said he'd like to have a beer with 
      me when all this was over.&quot; Today, Otto is doubtful about Pege's competence 
      as a security officer: &quot;I remember he told me he was involved in concerts 
      security as well (rock concerts). Although he was the security officer there, 
      he didn't know too much about Unix security or hacking techniques. In fact 
      he seemed to be ignorant of some basic things about Datapak such as reverse-charging&quot;.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Good versus Evil</b></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It appears as though 
      Pege was carried away by the idea of defending Sweden from imaginary terrorists. 
      Just as American counter-espionage was completely disinterested in the practically 
      harmless hacker hunted by Clifford Stoll, S&#196;PO was as disinterested 
      in the equally harmless hacker hunted by Pege. Otto wasn't even looking 
      for military secrets -- he was considered a threat just because he was so 
      curious.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So, on the 18th of December 
      the, &quot;white knight&quot; from Televerket drags the French dragon to 
      a Swedish court with the help of district prosecutor Christer Pettersson. 
      The trial itself is a farce -- soon it turns out that of all the people 
      present, only Pege and Otto have the technical knowledge required to understand 
      the summons from Televerket. Then the first thing Otto's counsel does as 
      the trial begins, is to throw Pege out of the court room, as no reasons 
      have been given for his presence. The only time that Pege is allowed in 
      the room, is when he is cross-examined by the court. Suddenly Otto himself 
      is the only one that understands what the prosecution is actually about. 
      None of the members of the court have any kind of practical technical knowledge.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&quot;The trial was real 
      fun because no one really knew the subject. Some of the documents I produced 
      during the trial were a bit dodgy, like this e-mail from some guy telling 
      me how to use reverse-charge on Televerket. I also produced a valid list 
      of all Swedish BBS:es, telling the judge that they were 'free access computer 
      systems'. Of course no one had a clue about the difference between a BBS 
      running on a 386SX in a 17-year-old teenager's room and a nationwide X.25 
      data network.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Otto doesn't think he 
      is guilty of any crime, and is wise enough to use simple descriptions which 
      the court can understand. He doesn't deny using Datapak exactly as much 
      as Televerket claims, and is prepared to pay for it. But he think it's unreasonable 
      that he shall pay the costs of tracing and investigation by Televerket.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Pege is called in only 
      to describe how the tracing of Otto was performed. In all other questions 
      they must refer to the preliminary investigation protocol, a horrible pile 
      of papers containing almost exclusively technical desciptions and different 
      lists of tracings carried out by Pege. Among the &quot;evidence&quot; is 
      Ottos own notes, some of them completely harmless, with detailed technical 
      information about phone numbers etc. to different computer systems all over 
      the world. Without further explanation of what kind of information this 
      is, these cryptic notes are called &quot;hacker notes&quot;. There are also 
      a bunch of print-outs of files found on Ottos hard disk.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This material has apparently 
      only been included in the protcol in order to make Otto look &quot;obscure&quot;. 
      The print-outs could just as well have been xerox copies of &quot;unsuitable 
      books&quot; from his bookshelf. The only purpose of including this material 
      must have been to throw suspicions on Otto for belonging to a certain subculture.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At some point the court 
      must have grown bored with the fact that Televerket had not been able to 
      present an understandable prosecution. Regardless of whom had lied or told 
      the truth, Ottos claim that he had believed that the calls were for free 
      seemed probable to the court. As the prosecutor could not prove the opposite, 
      the court found for the defendant. Televerket's claim for damages, and the 
      claim that Otto should be forced to leave the country, was also dismissed. 
      Televerket had to pay their own costs for the trial. In short, Televerket 
      lost, and Otto Sync won. This decision was made December 18th 1992, but 
      wasn't made public until January 8th.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Lookin back he says that 
      &quot;although I was guilty like hell and went to court, Televerket lost 
      the case.&quot;<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>All's well that..</b></font> 
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Televerket, now named 
      Telia, appealed the sentence in the court of appeals on January 15. As Otto 
      would only be present in Sweden until April 1st, they asked the court of 
      appeals to review the case before then, which was of course a hopeless request.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In September, Otto was 
      back in France, still hacking. Then, one night &quot;White Night&quot; turns 
      up at QSD again. &quot;I started chatting with Pege, who was expecting me 
      show up at appeals court in October&quot;, Otto says. The court of appeals 
      probably couldn't have him extradited to Sweden, and in any case he had 
      already booked a ticket to Bangkok for October 4.<br>
      <br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The court of appeals 
      considered the case at a hearing October 25th. As Televerket hadn't added 
      something new to their application of summons, and as Otto wasn't available, 
      the court of appeals decided to dismiss the case. Televerket and Pege lost 
      again.<br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
      </font> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Note: Otto Sync recently 
      left his job as an engineer at a huge, multi-national enterprise in Bangkok.
