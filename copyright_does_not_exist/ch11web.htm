      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Discussions about artificial intelligence 
        (AI) are frequent in many contexts, not least in those that are treated 
        in this book. That's why I've given AI a chapter of its own.</font><font size=2 face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"></font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">AI is a multi-disciplinary science, encompassing 
        electronics, computer science, psychology, sociology, philosophy, religion, 
        medicine, and mathematics. This is by no means an exaggeration; creating 
        AI entails knowing how &quot;normal&quot; intelligence works, which is 
        easier said than done - since the only object we know with certainty to 
        be intelligent is the human brain. AI ultimately concerns the study of 
        behavioral sciences in order to build models based on natural science. 
        Our intelligence, it has been discovered, is strongly connected to our 
        way of knowing the world, or our perception.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">AI research is a hot item at the universities, 
        and not without reason: for the first time in history, there is <i>money</i> 
        to be made in AI. Companies that are increasingly employing electronic 
        means for communication and administration are in need of computer programs 
        to handle routine tasks, like sorting electronic mail or maintaining inventory. 
        So-called intelligent <i>agents</i> are marketed, customized for various 
        standardized electronic tasks. From a cynical perspective, one could say 
        that industry for the first time can replace thinking humans with machines 
        in areas no one had thought could be automated. (I should add that it 
        can hardly be called <i>automation</i>, since the truly intelligent programs 
        actually <i>think</i>, as opposed to just acting according to a list of 
        rules).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is a number of approaches and orientations 
        within AI. Among the most prominent there are: <i>expert systems</i> (large 
        databases containing specific knowledge), <i>genetic algorithms</i> (simulated 
        evolution of mathematical formulas, for example, to suit a certain purpose), 
        and <i>neural networks</i> (imitation of the organizational structure 
        of the brain, using independent, parallel-processing nerve cells).&nbsp;As 
        information databases like those on the Internet become larger and more 
        numerous, agents can work directly with the information without having 
        to understand people. Why assign a person to do research when you might 
        as well let an agent do it, more quickly and for less money? (Whoever 
        has ever looked for information on the Internet will realize how useful 
        a more intelligent search tool would be).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">There is also research in the field of <i>artificial 
        life</i>, which really are &quot;living&quot; organisms that live and 
        reproduce in computer systems. Computer viruses constitute one form of 
        artificial life, albeit somewhat unsophisticated and destructive. Artificial 
        life has hitherto not achieved any substantial success. (Unless you want 
        to view computer viruses and all the companies and consultants that make 
        a living fighting them as a success - they have evidently boosted GNP).&nbsp;Research 
        in the field of artificial life began with a program called <i>Life</i>,<i> 
        </i>by <b>John Conway</b>, and was a mix between a computer game and calculated 
        simulation. <b>Bill Gosper</b>, hacker at MIT, became virtually obsessed 
        with this simulation. Later on, it was improved and renamed <i>Core Wars</i>, 
        the idea being that many small computer programs would try to expand and 
        fight over system memory (<i>core</i> memory), with the strongest ones 
        surviving. The programs are exposed to various environmental factors similar 
        to the demands put on real life: lonely or overcrowded individuals die, 
        programs are exposed to mutation risks, system resources vary with time 
        (daily rhythms), aging organisms die, etc. <b>Tom Ray</b> has been especially 
        successful in the field with his <i>Tierra </i>program. His artificial 
        life forms have, through simulated darwinistic evolution, managed to develop 
        programming solutions to certain specific problems that were better than 
        anything man-made.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">I have already mentioned that hackers have 
        a respect for artificial intelligence that is completely different from 
        that of people in general. A person growing up constantly surrounded by 
        computers does not see anything threatening in the fact that machines 
        can think. He/she sees the denunciation of AI as a sort of racism directed 
        towards a certain life form. If you criticize artificial intelligence, 
        saying that <i>it can never be the same, only humans can think</i>, etc., 
        then consider the fact that there is no scientific basis whatsoever for 
        supposing that the human brain is anything but a machine, although it 
        may be made of flesh.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">These thoughts date back to <b>Ada Lovelace<i> 
        </i></b>and <b>Charles Babbage</b>, two of the progenitors of computers, 
        who discuss the subject in a piece called <i>Thinking Machines</i>, published 
        in the 19th century. However, these ideas did not become widely known 
        until the 1960's, through films such as the horror movie <i>Colossus - 
        The Forbins Project</i> (1969), in which intelligent military computers 
        take over the world. This notion also figures in the <i>Terminator</i> 
        films, with the only significant difference being that the computer's 
        name is <i>Skynet</i> - thus, not much new under the sun in popular sci-fi. 
        The fear of artificial intelligence actually dates all the way back to 
        <b>Mary Shelley's</b> <i>Frankenstein</i> (1818), and perhaps even further 
        back in history.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">In the fiction of Frankenstein, the fear 
        of AI is personified. This story, about a scientist who creates a lethal 
        intelligence, has become one of the new symbols of the industrialized 
        world, in the same class as early Greek mythology. There is a connection 
        between the Bible and Frankenstein, in that the creation (mankind in the 
        Book of Moses, the monster in Frankenstein) rebel against its creator 
        (God and human, respectively).&nbsp;In Judaic mythology there is a corresponding 
        myth about the clay-man <b>Golem</b>, who runs amok when its master forgets 
        to control the creature. It has occurred to me how far ahead of its time 
        this myth was: Golem was made of clay, and computers are made of silicone, 
        which is made from sand. The maker of Golem, <b>Rabbi L&#246;w</b>, feeds 
        a piece of parchment with the name of God on it into the creature's mouth, 
        in order to make it &quot;run&quot;. This is comparable to the engineer 
        &quot;feeding&quot; software into the computer. To stop the runaway Golem, 
        the Rabbi removes the parchment from its mouth, whereupon the creature 
        collapses into a pile of dried mud, robbed of its spark of life.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Thus, the fear that mankind - like God - 
        will create intelligent life from dead matter is found as early as in 
        the two 19th-century myths described above. This rather unfounded fear 
        of <i>rebellion against God</i> makes up the foundation of much of the 
        hostility directed towards AI research. The fear is based in the Biblical 
        myth of Adam and Eve eating the forbidden fruit, and the possibility that 
        another creation will follow in our footsteps. I will, however, overlook 
        these myths, and instead focus the argument on the philosophy underlying 
        AI-research: <i>Pragmatism</i> with its heritage of Fallibilism, Nihilism, 
        and Zen-philosophy. (Don't let these strange word discourage you from 
        reading on!)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">One could ask <i>why</i> scientists promptly 
        have to try to create artificial intelligence. After all, there are already 
        people, so why attempt to create something new, better, something alien? 
        Asking this question of a scientist in the field is akin to asking a young 
        couple why they promptly want to have children. Why raise a new generation 
        that will question everything you have constructed? The answer is that 
        it's something that simply just happens, or is done: it is a challenge, 
        a desire to create something that will live on, an instinct for evolution. 
        This is perhaps also what partly motivates hackers to create computer 
        viruses: the pleasure of seeing something grow and propagate.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our entire society and our lives are so 
        interlinked that they cannot be separated. Society, machines, and humanity 
        - everything has to progress. Evolution doesn't allow any closed doors, 
        and AI is, in my view, only another step on the path of evolution. I see 
        this as something positive, while others are terrified.&nbsp;At the same 
        time, one shouldn't forget to note the <i>commercial</i> interests underlying 
        the expansion of AI. Computers reading forms, sorting information, and 
        distributing it, is obviously simply another way for the market to &quot;rationalize&quot; 
        people out of the production chain, automating clerical work, and making 
        the secretary and the accountant obsolete. The board of directors of a 
        corporation is, as usual, only interested in making money and accumulating 
        capital. <i>Wouldn't you?</i> What is the hidden nature of this complex 
        entity (or as I would refer to it, <i>superentity</i>) that we call <i>&quot;the 
        market&quot;</i>, and which constantly drives this process of development 
        forward?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you are interested in knowing more about 
        AI and its philosophical aspects, it is to your advantage to read a book 
        called <i>The Intelligent Age of Machines</i>, by <b>Raymond Kurzweil</b> 
        (1990). To learn more about the inner workings of AI, read <b>Douglas 
        Hofstadter's</b> <i>G&#246;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</i>, 
        which is both an elevating and depressing work. In one respect, it is 
        a scientific validation of Kafka's thesis: <i>to correctly comprehend 
        something and at the same time misunderstand it are not mutually exclusive</i>, 
        which is an observation that (fascinatingly enough) is akin to the paradoxes 
        within Zen Buddhism, a religion that in some aspects border on pure philosophy. 
        To explain some of AI's mechanisms, I need to explain some things about 
        the part of Zen that is associated with philosophers like <b>Mumon</b>, 
        and which has less to do with sitting around in a lotus position and meditating 
        all day. Zen, in itself, is a philosophy that can be dissociated from 
        Buddhism and viewed separately. Buddhism is based on respect for life, 
        in all its forms, Zen, by itself, makes no such demands, being a non-normative, 
        non-religious philosophy.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>Zen, or the Art of Breaking Out of Formal 
        Systems</b><br>
        Zen has also become one of the most influential &quot;new age&quot; philosophies 
        in the West during the 80's and 90's. Books like <i>Zen and the Art of 
        Motorcycle Maintenance</i> sell amazingly well. among other things, Zen 
        Buddhism suggests that the entity that Western tradition calls God (and 
        what the Buddhists call the Brahma of the Buddha) is in fact a sum of 
        all the independent processes in the universe, and not a sentient force. 
        Therefore, God is equally present in the souls of humans as in the circuits 
        of a computer or the cylinder shafts of a motorcycle. Put simply, Zen 
        is one long search for the connection between natural processes, in the 
        cosmos or the microcosmos, and this search in itself constitutes a process 
        that interfaces with the others. Zen Buddhism is <i>the search in itself</i>, 
        the point being that Zen (an abstract term for &quot;the answer&quot;) 
        will never be found. Searching for Zen means that one continually come 
        to a point where one answers a question with both <i>yes </i>and <i>no.</i> 
        For example:</font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Q: Is the ball in the bottle?<br>
          A: In one way, yes, if the bottle's inside is its inside, and in one 
          way, no, if the bottle's outside is its inside.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Zen constantly toys with our way of <i>defining</i> 
        our environment, our method of labeling things as well as people. Zen 
        teaches us to see through the inadequacies of out own language and assists 
        us in dismantling fallacious systems, as in when, for example, we've gotten 
        the idea that all criminals are swarthy (or that all hackers break into 
        computer systems!). Zen is the thesis that no perfect formal systems exist, 
        that <i>there is no</i> perfect way of perceiving reality. Kurt G&#246;del, 
        the mathematician, proved that there are no perfect systems within the 
        natural sciences, and the fact that there are no perfect systems within 
        religion should be apparent to anyone who isn't a fundamentalist.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Zen could be said to be based on the following 
        supposition:&nbsp;<i>The only absolute truth is that there are no absolute 
        truths. </i>A paradox! - which is, naturally, a perfect starting point 
        for the thesis that reality cannot be captured and all formal systems 
        (like human language, mathematics, etc.) must contain errors. Even the 
        proposition that reality is incomplete is incomplete! <i>Truth cannot 
        be fully expressed in words</i> - hence the necessity of art and other 
        forms of expression. I will end the discussion of Zen now, but hopefully 
        you understand that many become confused and annoyed when one tries to 
        explain Zen, given that the explanation is that there is no explanation. 
        For example, note a quote by <b>William S. Burroughs</b>: <i>&quot;language 
        is a virus from space&quot;</i>, expressing his frustration with the limitations 
        of human language. Even Nietzsche criticized language, finding it hopelessly 
        limited, and feminist <b>Dorothy Smith</b> has a theory concerning the 
        use of language to control the distribution of power in society.<sup><a href="#FTNT1">(1)</a></sup> 
        In the Western philosophical tradition, the equivalent of Zen is called 
        <i>Fallibilism</i>, a philosophy based on the theory that all knowledge 
        is preliminary. This has subsequently been developed into a philosophical 
        theory called <i>pragmatism</i>, which views all formal systems as fallible, 
        and thus judges them based on function rather than construction. G&#246;del's 
        Incompleteness Theorem is probably the most tangible indication that this 
        conception of the world is correct.<sup><a href="#FTNT2">(2)</a></sup></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">A lot of modern mathematical theory of so-called 
        <i>non-formal systems</i> are associated with both Zen and Chaos theory. 
        A non-formal system creates a formal system to solve a problem. In order 
        to have a chance of understanding a (superficially) chaotic reality, we 
        must first simplify it by creating formal systems on different levels 
        of description, but also retain the capacity to break down these systems 
        and create new ones. For example, we know that humans are made up of cells. 
        We also know that we are made up of atoms, and as such, of pure energy. 
        Nature invites to so many levels of description that we have to sift through 
        them to find those that we need to complete the tasks we have selected. 
        This is called intelligence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are also other philosophies that draw 
        on parts of Zen: for example, <i>Tao</i> views contradictory pairs such 
        as right/wrong or one/zero (the smallest building blocks of information) 
        as holy entities, and focuses on finding the &quot;golden mean&quot; between 
        them (the archetype is <i>Yin </i>and <i>Yang</i>, a kind of original 
        contradictory pair). Our Western concept of thesis-antithesis-synthesis 
        also belongs to this group. The strength - and weakness - in these approaches 
        are that they instill in their followers a belief that <i>moderation is 
        always best</i>, which can be both true and false according to Zen (depending 
        on how you view it). All such attempts to force reality into formal systems 
        are of course interesting, but definitely temporary and constantly subject 
        to adaptation. Another philosophical system using this mode of thought 
        was the pre-Christian Gnosticism, where the original opposites are <i>God 
        </i>and <i>Matter</i>. These become intertwined within a sequence of <i>Aeons</i> 
        (ages of time, imaginary worlds, or divine beings). Gnosticism probably 
        originates (in turn) from an old Persian religion called <i>Parsism</i>, 
        created by the well-known philosopher <b>Zarathustra</b>, who initially 
        claimed that the world was based on such opposites.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Zen's way of thinking is partially a confirmation 
        of the so-called <i>nihilistic</i> view of reality, in which objective 
        truth does not exist, and partially a denial of it: it is simply a matter 
        of point-of-view. Objective truth exists <i>inside</i> formal systems, 
        whereas <i>outside </i>them, it does not. By breaking out of a formal 
        system in which reality is described in terms of right and wrong, or intermediate 
        terms such as <i>more right than wrong</i>, one finds a part of the core 
        of intelligence. Being intelligent means being able to build an ordered 
        system out of chaos, and thoroughly enough to be able to view one's own 
        system from the inside and adjust one's own thoughts according to its 
        rules. AI research has - in an amazing fashion - shown that this ability 
        is completely vital to <i>any intelligent operation whatsoever</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The difference between the real world and 
        the one pictured inside the formal system of one's own creation has ruffled 
        the feathers of such grandfathers of philosophy as Plato, Kant, and Schopenhauer. 
        It has made them decide, after languishing analysis, that the real world 
        is defective and incapable of approaching their own perfect, mathematical 
        world of ideas. (Please note my mild insolence; as a 24-year-old layman 
        I shouldn't be able to claim the right to even speak of these great philosophers. 
        The alert reader would notice that I'm very busy questioning traditional 
        authorities ;-). In science, this conflict is known as the subject-object 
        controversy. Even in such &quot;hard&quot; sciences as physics this conflict 
        has proved to be decisive, especially in <i>Bell's Theorem</i> (well-known 
        among physicists), which has puzzled many a scientist. (I'm not going 
        to go into the details of Bell's Theorem, but I'm employing it as a reference 
        for those who are familiar with it).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">When AI researchers sought the answer to 
        the mystery of intelligence, they came into conflict with scientific paradigms. 
        We need to use intelligence to understand intelligence. We need a blueprint 
        for making blueprints; a theory of theoretical methods, a paradigm for 
        building paradigms, etc. They found a paradox in which a formal system 
        would be described in terms of another formal system. This is when they 
        took G&#246;del's theorem to heart - a proof that all formal systems are 
        paradoxical. The solution to the problem of creating a formal system for 
        intelligence was self-reference, just like a neuron in the brain will 
        change its way of processing information by - just that - processing information. 
        The answer to intelligence wasn't tables, strict sets of rules, or mathematics. 
        Intelligence wasn't mechanical. For intelligence to flourish, it would 
        have to be partially <i>unpredictable</i>, <i>contradictory</i>, and <i>flexible.</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many hackers and net-users are devoted Zen-philosophers, 
        not least because many of the functions within computers and networks 
        are fairly contradictory. The section of computer science concerned with 
        AI is self-contradictory to the highest degree. <i>Programming</i> is 
        also the art of creating order from an initially chaotic system of possible 
        instructions, culminating in the finished product of a computer program. 
        If this section has been hard to understand, please read it again; it 
        is worth comprehending.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"> <b>Humans as Machines - The Computer as 
        a Divine Creation<br>
        </b>Most hackers view people as advanced machinery, and there's really 
        nothing wrong with this; it is simply a new way of looking at things, 
        another point of view within the multi-facetted science of psychology. 
        Hackers in general are futurists, and to them the machine (and thus the 
        human) is something beautiful and vigorous. I'll willingly admit that 
        to a certain extent I also view humans as machines, but I'd like to tone 
        that statement down a bit by saying that we (like computers) are <i>information 
        processors</i> - we are born with certain information coded in our genes, 
        and in growing up we assimilate more and more information from our environment. 
        The result is a complex mass of information that we refer to as an <i>individual</i>. 
        The process by which information is handled and stored in the individual 
        is known as intelligence. The individual also interacts with the environment 
        by symbolically absorbing and emitting pieces of information, and thereby 
        becomes a part of an even larger process, which is in itself intelligent. 
        (If you're of a religious persuasion, this could be taken as an example 
        of hubris) But what about the <i>difference</i> between computers and 
        humans?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Two things: the computer knows who has created 
        it, and human life is clearly time-limited. It has been proposed that 
        the uniqueness of a human &quot;soul&quot; is a product of just these 
        two factors, and that it's therefore only uncertainty and finitude that 
        makes life &quot;<i>worth living&quot;</i>. Of course, the theory could 
        be challenged by proposing that its two premises are negotiable from a 
        long-term perspective. Hereby the reader will have to draw his or her 
        own metaphysical conclusions; the subject is virtually interminable, and 
        the audience inexhaustible. <br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman">By delving 
        deep into psychology, the subject becomes simpler. An intelligent system, 
        whether artificial or natural, must be checked against a surrounding system 
        (what we might term a <i>meta-system</i>) in order to know the direction 
        in which to develop itself. In an AI system designed to recognize characters, 
        &quot;rewards&quot; and &quot;punishments&quot; are employed until the 
        system learns how to correctly distinguish valid and invalid symbols. 
        This requires two functions within the system: the ability to exchange 
        information, and the ability to <i>reflect</i> on this exchange.&nbsp;In 
        an AI system, this is a controlled, two-step sequence: first information 
        is processed, then the process is reflected upon. In a person, the information 
        processing (usually) takes place during the day, and the match against 
        the &quot;correct&quot; pattern occurs at night, in the form of dreams 
        in which the events are recollected and compared to our <i>real</i> motives 
        (the <i>subconscious</i>). The similarity is striking.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman">Through this 
        line of reasoning, we can draw the conclusion that people have an internal 
        system for judging correct action against incorrect action. As if this 
        wasn't enough, we also know that we can alter the plans by which we act 
        - i.e., we are not forced to follow a specific path. In this sense, humans 
        are just as paradoxical as any informal system, since we have the ability 
        to break out of the system and re-evaluate our objectives.&nbsp;However, 
        the great philosophers of psychology, <b>Sigmund Freud</b> and <b>Carl 
        Jung</b>, found that there was a set of symbols and motives that <i>were 
        not</i> subject to modification, but rather common to all persons. Freud 
        spoke of the overriding <i>drives</i>, mainly the sexual and survival 
        drives. Jung expanded the argument to encompass several <i>archetypes</i>, 
        which referred to certain fundamental notions of what is good and what 
        is evil.<sup><a href="#FTNT3">(3)</a></sup> These archetypal drives, which 
        seem to exist in all animals, appears to be the engine that propels humans 
        into the effort of exploring and trying to understand their environment.</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman">This is the 
        most fundamental difference between persons and machines. There is nothing 
        that says that we should have to let intelligent machines be driven by 
        the same urges as we are. Instead, we can equip them with a <i>drive</i> 
        to solve the problems for which they were constructed. When the machine 
        evaluates its own actions, it is then constantly driven towards doing 
        our bidding. <b>Isaac Asimov</b>, the science-fiction writer, suggested 
        such things in his robot novels through the concept of the laws of <i>robotics</i>, 
        by which robots were driven by an almost pathological desire to please 
        their human masters. This relationship is also found in the modern film 
        <i>Robocop</i>, in which an android policeman is driven by his will to 
        indiscriminately uphold the law.</font></font></p>
      <p><font color="#333333"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Towards 
        an Artificial Age - AI and Society<br>
        </font></b></font><font face="Times New Roman">Aspects of AI is mirrored 
        by the media of our time - <i>Blade Runner </i>is about the difference 
        between man and machine, AI figures heavily in cyberpunk novels, music 
        and film, and in 1995 the movie Frankenstein makes a comeback in the theaters. 
        Coincidence? Hardly.&nbsp;An exciting example of this trend is Arnold 
        Schwarzenegger's role as the robot in <i>Terminator 2</i>. In the film, 
        the artificial intelligence holds human characteristics, as a result of 
        being programmed by a human rebel instead of a brutal military force. 
        It also touches upon aspects of the consequences of carelessly handling 
        technology (as when Rabbi L&#246;w lost control of his Golem). Of particular 
        interest is the scene in which the robot, being machine, simply follows 
        its programmed instructions to obliterate people standing in its way as 
        opposed to finding peaceful solutions. The lead character, John (which 
        incidentally happens to be a skilled hacker), discovers a dangerous &quot;programming 
        bug&quot; in the robot's instruction set, which he corrects. The message 
        of the film is that technology and AI are good things - if used properly 
        and supervised by human agents. The real danger is people's ignorant nonchalance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Swedish movie <i>Femte Generationen</i> 
        (&quot;The Fifth Generation&quot;) again deserves being mentioned in this 
        context. Fifth-generation computer systems are simply another name for 
        artificially intelligent systems.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Lars Gustavsson</b> makes a strong impression 
        with his beautiful sci-fi novel, <i>Det S&#228;llsamma Djuret Fr&#229;n 
        Norr</i> (&quot;The Strange Beast from the North&quot;), which treats 
        the metaphysical aspects of AI in a thorough and entertaining manner. 
        His thoughts on decentralized intelligence are especially exciting, which 
        suggest that a society of ants could be considered intelligent, whereas 
        a single ant could not - and in this manner, all of humanity could be 
        viewed as one cohesive, intelligent organism. This view is taken from 
        sociology, which has become very important to AI research.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Flows of information are an indication of 
        intelligence. This is confirmed in the model of society as a unitary sentient 
        force. The intelligence of individuals and societies are undoubtedly related; 
        the ability to store and process information through the construction 
        and dissolution of formal systems is a sign of intelligence. Society is 
        an organism, but at the same time it is not (yes, this is very Zen). These 
        ideas go all the way back to the founder of sociology, <b>Auguste Comte</b>. 
        I have myself coined the term <i>superindividuals</i> as a label for these 
        macro-intelligences known as <i>corporations, the market, the state, the 
        capital,</i> and so on. I will return to this subject further ahead.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">Again, it is possible to emphasize the relatedness 
        of chaos research and intelligence; intelligence can be seen on many different 
        levels, each constituting a formal system in itself. One system is akin 
        to another, and they form as strangely coherent pattern. Our intelligence 
        seems to be united with our ability to enforce chaos.<br>
        <br>
        </font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#333333"><b>Alan Turing 
        and the Turing Test<br>
        </b></font><font face="Times New Roman">Alan Turing was one of the very 
        first people concerned with making machines intelligent. He proposed a 
        test that could decide whether or not a system was intelligent - the so-called 
        Turing Test. It consisted of placing a person in a room with a terminal 
        that was either connected to a terminal controlled by another person, 
        or to a computer that pretended to be a person. If the test subjects couldn't 
        tell the difference between man and machine, i. e. that they couldn't 
        make a correct judgment in half of the cases, the computer could be said 
        to be intelligent.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">This test was rather quickly subject to 
        criticism by way of a theory called The Chinese Room. This entailed running 
        the Turing Test in Chinese, with a Chinese-speaking person at one terminal 
        and a person that didn't speak Chinese at the other. For the non-Chinese 
        person to have a chance to answer the questions posed by the Chinese-speaker, 
        he/she was to be presented with set of rules consisting of symbols, grammar, 
        etc., through which sensible answers could be formulated without the subject 
        knowing an ounce of Chinese. By simply performing lookups in tables and 
        books it would seem like the person in fact spoke Chinese and was intelligent, 
        although he or she was just following a set of rules.&nbsp;The little 
        slave running back and forth, interpreting the Chinese-speaker's questions 
        without knowing anything, was compared to the hardware of the computer, 
        the machine. The books and the rules for responding constituted the software, 
        or the computer program. In this way, it was argued that the computer 
        couldn't be intelligent, but rather only capable of following given instructions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">However, it turned out that this objection 
        was false. The one that the Chinese-speaker is communicating with is not 
        solely the person sitting at the other end, but the entire system, including 
        the terminal, books, rule sets, etc., that the poor stressed-out fellow 
        in the other room used to formulate answers. Even if the person sitting 
        at the other end of the line was not intelligent, the system as a whole 
        was intelligent. The same goes for a computer: even if the machine or 
        the program is intelligent in itself, the entire system of machine + program 
        very well could be.&nbsp;The case is the same for a human - a single neuron 
        in the brain is not intelligent. Not even entire parts of the brain, or 
        the brain itself, are intelligent, since they cannot communicate. The 
        system of a person with both a body and a brain, however, can be intelligent!<sup><a href="#FTNT4">(4)</a></sup></font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">From this follows the slightly unpleasant 
        realization that every intelligent system must constantly process information 
        in order to stay intelligent. We have to accept sensory input and in some 
        way respond to it to properly be called intelligent. A human without the 
        ability to receive or express information is therefore not intelligent! 
        A flow of information is an indication of the presence of intelligence. 
        From this stems the concept of brain deat - a human without intelligence 
        is not a human.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman">We might finish this chapter by defining 
        what intelligence really is (according to Walleij):&nbsp;Intelligence 
        is the ability to create, within a seemingly chaotic flow of information, 
        systems for the purpose of sorting and evaluating this flow, and at the 
        same time incessantly revise and break down these systems in order to 
        create new ones. (Note that this definition is paradoxical, since it describes 
        the very process by which the author was able to formulate it. You can't 
        win&#133; :) <br>
